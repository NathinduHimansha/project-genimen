I am here to assure you that the phone in fact does! You must contact Verizon tier two tech support and explain that you have a factory unlocked Oneplus 7T and would like to register the IMEI  number with their system and activate GSMA-less provisioning on your phone number who's sim card you will be using. It will take one-three days to get the IMEI in the ir system but afterwards simply put your old sim card in your new phone and it should work like a charm. If you have any issues just call and talk to tier two tech support again as they are very helpful and knowledgeable. Enjoy your new budget flagship experience!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Such a great deal!

Muy rápido en las aplicaciones y funciones que tiene.

So slim &amp; lightweight. I hate putting cases. But since it is slim, case doesn't make it look bad. Battery life is good, but not extraordinary, which you would expect with the high refresh screen. The display is buttery smooth. It's very fast. Camera is great. What I liked is that very few phones give the full manual control of camera. The long shutter time definitely helps with astrophotography.  Fingerprint reader is fast &amp; face recognition is blazing fast. Overall a very good phone.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  For the price its a good phone. Haven't had any complaints with performance. Overall a good feature packed upper mid range phone.

Nothing fancy, just new enough to run everything without issues.<br><br>I shopped around a LOT (I dont think phones should cost over 300$ but it's virtually impossible to find a solidly good phone that isnt) and I found this.<br><br>I dropped my ATT nano SIM in during setup and it was instantly on the network, no issues (YAY!) and then I set to work setting everything else up.<br><br>I gotta say I was SUPER impressed by how little bloatware there is on this phone. So that was a huge plus. I have also found dozens of small features I've missed out on with my 10 year old samsung (like the ability to action within the notification!).<br><br>But there were also some cool features my friends with their iphone and pixel didnt have. Like the physical switch to choose silent/vibrate/ring without messing with the screen, and separate dedicate media volume buttons on the other side of the phone. And man does this phone get loud! A little distortion at the highest end but lowering to avoid the distortion is still loud.<br><br>I've been able to add all my apps and settings and such in and the phone is still fast and responsive.<br><br>Additionally, the display settings have some serious kick. I'm talking OLED TV type kick so that was a big surprise. The cameras appear to be really good as well.<br><br>All in all I am incredibly happy with this purchase especially since I lucked out on a lightning deal so it was only $300 for me which was the perfect price for this much phone!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  As stated in the title, this phone has been constantly reading ""no SIM card"" when connected to bluetooth in my car. It will reconnect briefly but then it will repeatedly do the same thing . Conveniently happened right outside of the return window for amazon. Go figure. So now I\'m stuck with this garbage phone. This is the second time I\'ve given Oneplus a chance because I really want to like the product, but there are just way too many bugs. Save yourself time, money, and most importantly stress. Just go with any of the major brands instead.\n</span>', '<span>\n  got this one to replace Huawei Mate 9, and connecting to T mobile network.<br>Never got issue with T mobile signal on other phones in the past few years, both android and Iphone.<br>However, this one drop the connection like crazy, at least two or three times a day.

All other 3 phones from the 4 line plan work well in the same location, the old phone never failed me in several years. And all the nightmare started with this new phone.<br>However, the customer representative asked me to contact T mobile to resolve the problem.<br><br>I refused to call t mobile, waiting 30 mins and to asking some a question I do not know.<br><br>Then they started to  giving me long instruction to debug the phone. holding this key for 15 sec, then holding two keys then release one key ............... Is it crazy to ask customer to do it?<br><br>Then it comes to common sense question.  They claim that manual re-boot could re-connect the 4G, this phone is consider working well.

It takes more than one hour, much longer than expected.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was a little skeptical as model is HD1907 and not the US version.

You haven't been scammed if you don't find the wired headphones  in the box!<br>Original review: I say it's the best, with a grain of salt, read the cons to know why!<br>To start off, Samsung did an amazing job with this phone, so much that they rendered the fairly new, still very expensive, S20 Ultra, almost obsolete!<br>But I'm not gonna review both units here, so for those of you looking for quick pros &amp; cons, here you go.<br>Pros:<br>- AMAZING display, I had so many high end phones, including the IPhone 11 pro max and Google Pixel 4XL &amp; even the note 10, but this screen here bests all of them. The high refresh rate, the beautiful colors, and the better ratio (it's a little wider than the S20 ultra for example), all this makes for an outstanding screen.<br>- Great main camera. The pictures are just perfect in almost all light conditions. I dunno how much better is the 108 MP mode, it bothered me a little that cropping a 108 MP picture didn't yield the perfect result, but all in all, the camera is top notch, in all its modes. The videos are even better. You won't find a phone with a better main camera on the market.<br>- The S pen is pretty useful for taking notes! I didn't feel like I needed it for anything else except, may be, for a selfie, so eventhough it isn't the biggest selling point, it's worth mentioning.<br>- It looks great! Yup, design wise, that phone looks really good, that it feels bad putting any covers on it. I personally just ordered a very slim, transparent case &amp; I wouldn't recommend anything else.<br>There are some added gimmicky features that you can find almost everywhere online, but I personally loved the direct share, where I can show anything I want from my phone and cast it to a smart TV or one with a Google chrome cast attached to it, it happened a lot before that I needed to show many people at the same time, whatever it is that was on my phone, photos or a certain app, and that feature here makes it so easy.<br>Cons:<br>- I dunno how this isn't mentioned anywhere, but the selfie camera isn't great at all in low light conditions. Yes in the morning, outdoor, it is very good, but other than that it's just not great! I could see myself buying the next Google Pixel instead, just for this.<br>- Battery life isn't good enough either. It's worse than my S20 Ultra, and it was no surprise, since Samsung decided to give this phone a smaller battery 🙄<br>I find myself charging it twice a day, which really isn't practical.<br>Just for those 2 points, added to the fact that it's a super expensive phone, I had to give it 4 stars.<br>Now if it gets the Google Pixel software for the selfie camera, and a full day of battery life that would have been the best phone ever made! But I guess we'll have to wait for next year for that!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  To preface this, I am being forced to purchase a new device as all US networks are apparently no longer supporting Huawei devices in the very near future. I decided to give the Note a try as it seemed that it would keep up with my daily usage for work and I've always desired having the S pen.<br><br>I've been using this phone for a few days now and it is soooooo slow. Apps and Google searches take way too long to load. Hotspot is just downright awful. Battery life is sub par. Fast charging is much slower than what I had. Camera doesn't quite compare to my old phone's Leica camera, which I figured it wouldn't. Not sure what kind of scam this is but I'm definitely returning it. Also didn't come with earbuds or the phone clone connector. Don't get me wrong, the phone looks great. The S pen was everything I was hoping for. The screen is spectacular and super bright. The 120hz refresh rate was cool for maybe the first 10 sec, then I realized it was a pretty worthless feature. Scrolling to the end of long page in a few seconds does me no good when I'm trying to read posts or search for information on that page.<br><br>I went to AT&amp;T to get my phone diagnosed. He tested it against his Note 20 Ultra and his phone ended up being twice as fast as mine running the same speed test, on the same network, on the same unlimited plan... all after my device took an additional 10-15 sec to connect before even starting the test.<br><br>My advice, don't waste your money. Just because Samsung markets like crazy doesn't mean their phones are any good. For a flagship device and the price point, this phone falls well short of being worth it. I came from a two year old Huawei Mate 20 Pro and it's sad that Samsung can't make a phone that is able to compete with it. Not what I expected for my first Note phone. I've never been a Samsung hater by any means, but this experience just solidifies my previous viewpoint to never buy a Samsung device. Won't make that mistake again.<br><br>Update:<br>I made that mistake again... In my defense, I was hoping this was an isolated incident or just a simple case of a bad device. I ordered another unlocked Note 20 Ultra from Best Busy to compare. Unfortunately for me, it was not. That device had all the same issues. Slow network speeds with AT&amp;T (I live in a major city so this shouldn't happen, period). This phone also didn't come with earbuds so it seems like Samsung is just getting cheap on consumers.<br><br>I tried swapping the SIM card with my girlfriend's S20 and it still didn't work. All calls were sent directly to voicemail and text messages were very hit or miss. AT&amp;T had no idea, but I'm sure it was out of the hourly employees realm to troubleshoot. I had to switch back to my Huawei Mate 20 Pro. After 10 min or so I got a couple delayed text messages that were sent days ago in response to a text I originally sent from the Note 20 Ultra. SMH...<br><br>I'm just downright confused at this point. Not sure whether it's an issue with the device or with the 5G network, or both. You also can't change which network bands you want to use, ie. turn 5G off. You can only toggle 2G on and off. My buddy has full control with his Note 10+ which is really mind boggling. Either way, both phones have been returned.<br><br>I'm self-employed and my phone is my lifeline. I don't have time to play these games or wait for Samsung to release an update. Such a shame because I really wanted to like this phone and I loved the S pen so far. Samsung just has a history of not being able to meet my expectations. The even bigger shame is that I can't upgrade to better Huawei device...\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  \xa0I got this on launch day and it had a defect where the S pen wasn't registering in a large circular area on the screen. Amazon sent me a replacement and it had the exact same failure. I'm done with it. I've had 2 other notes in the past and loved them, but having this almost $1500 phone fail right out of the box is where my love of the Note ends.<br><br>IMPORTANT EDIT:  I Noticed this same issue occurring with my Note 10+ after I returned this phone (twice). This phenomenon was being caused by a Steelie magnetic mount on the back of the case. So if you are using a magnetic mount or have the phone close to a magnetic field, you will encounter this exact same issue.<br><br>I have changed the review score to reflect this new information.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  \xa0Please, do not buy your $1,300 phone on Amazon! Buy it from somewhere legit or some where you can be sure that you get what you deserve. Like Samsung Store or bestbuy. You might have to spend extra bucks, but it\'s more worth it!<br><br>I purchased ""New"" (not ""Used"" Amazon!) Samsung Note 20 Ultra 512 GB for $1,099 and I thought it was a good deal, but I was wrong.<br><br>I recieved my Note 20 Ultra 512GB today, and I was so upset to unbox this package. My first impression with this phone was so bad. The box of phone was not sealed with the plastic wrap like the new phone should have. Instead, it was sealed with the two circle stickers(one on the top left and one on the bottom right. The sign of ""Note20 Ultra 5G"" was weirdly printed. You can see from the picture that it is a little crooked. Upon further inspection, I suspect that this package might have been opened before because of the stickers seal and noises when I shaked the box, and I was right. I found a bunch of fingerprints and a pen sticking out. I popped the s-pen back in, and tried to shake the phone, and you can here that something is loosen in the video. I am not sure if this phone suppose to have this sound, but it is so unpleasant to hear and it makes this phone cheap. I spent $1000+ on this phone and I didn\'t expect any of these.<br><br>This is not the first time Amazon turned me down. It is my fault for trusting Amazon when I know I shouldn\'t especially when it comes to big purchases like this. Now I learned that I might be better off with the manufacturer website if I want to purchase something like this. Buyers!!! Please, be ware!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I do not recommend buying.  the charger stopped working after just 2 hours of use.  and did not bring the headphones.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  The cameras, the S-pen, the AMOLED screen quality, the 120 Hz refresh rate, the 5G data connection, the build quality, etc. are all top notch. This phone will probably hold the crown for best Android phone for a good while, and it has key feature bumps that made me especially want this phone--namely the 5G and the 120 Hz screen.<br><br>I would definitely recommend a solid case if you're planning to spend this much money on a phone. I bought a Spigen case which effectively reduces the camera bump on the back to allow the phone to sit flat on a desk. The IP68 rating means that it will be fine with water and dust, but drop protection is still a must. I saw a stat recently that something like 2/3 of people report incurring drop damage to their phone (for all phones not specifically this phone).<br><br>Other thoughts: I think it's interesting that most middle class people can afford the best phone that you can possibly purchase for a product that is in your pocket, everyday, all the time. You can't say that about cars, houses, clothes, but you could definitely swing buying the best phone that money can buy once every 3-4 years if it's important enough to you. For me it is, and I'm very happy with this phone.<br><br>Lastly: Google Pixel, 1+, Apple, etc. can only hope to match some of the features that this phone has to offer, but I highly doubt that they will exceed this phone's specs on yet to be release products. Just my opinion as a phone guy, but the best that they could hope to do is give you a better value on specific features. If you're somebody looking for the best value on a calling and texting machine, then this phone is not for you. This phone is for somebody that wants the best cameras, pocket computing power, &amp; screen quality that money can buy you right now.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Purchased new phone, arrived damaged.

Plus, this is the first refurbished phone I bought. Anyway, the phone arrived early and it was in a white box that I first thought was my phone case order. I didn\'t expect it to be the phone. It was inside a bubble wrap packet along with a generic charger and key pin for the sim card.<br>1. The phone was in good condition: clean, scratch free, and with a small sticker on top saying ""Qualcommm 4G.""<br>2. The buttons are funtional: volume, power button and Bixby button working too.<br>3. Last update from system showed December 2018, so I updated it and it worked. From 8.0, my software is now 9.0 Android Pie. I liked how Samsung made it simple to navigate the phone features with the new update. (Well, it works for me)<br>4. Samsung account working. Bixby working.<br>5. Health sensor at the back is functional. Fingerprint scanning too! I tried both 😉<br>6. Camera is really nice! Works like brand new! 🤩<br>7. Charging time took me like 2-3hrs to full battery. Using LTE and sometimes wifi with hotspot, it lasted a day for me.. I also tested it on my game, YouTube, and browsing just to observe the battery life span and so far so good.<br><br>Bottomline, this unlocked s8 met my expectations.. or should I say more! I love it! It\'s like brand new phone! No regrets buying from this seller. I had 3 choices and reading reviews multiple times gave me anxiety rather than helping me decide LOL, but one review helped me and I\'m glad I\'ve decided to choose this seller.<br>I\'m reviewing this base on my one week experience with the phone and so far I\'m loving it! ❤ *image to be showed later*\n</span>', '<span>\n  TLDR: What a nightmare. I tried to upgrade my phone, but instead received a blocked phone and had my original phone disabled for two days.<br><br>I\'ve bought multiple phones on Amazon before without any issues, but now I understand how low of a bar it is to be ""inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified suppliers."" The phone arrived in a timely fashion and booted up just fine. It connected to WiFi and successfully transferred all my apps and info and data from my previous Samsung device. However, after inserting my SIM card, the phone would not send or receive text messages or phone calls. I reviewed and updated the APN settings (which is a common adjustment for phones purchased online), but I had no luck. Eventually, I learned that the phone had been ""blacklisted"" as a lost or stolen phone, meaning it would never work on any carrier. Among all the checking and testing, this nearly-criminal supplier never thought to check the most basic (and essential) functionality of the phone. I am still appalled at the lack of due diligence from a business whose core service involves buying and selling used phones.<br><br>My next thought was: ""That\'s why I buy from Amazon - the return policy. I\'ll just go back to my original phone and all will be well...""<br><br>So I pulled my SIM card out and put it back into my original phone. No big deal. But, now the phone I had been using for over a year wouldn\'t send or receive texts, calls and data. For two whole workdays (during which I rely on my phone for work), I struggled to figure out the issue until I was able to weasel out of work and brought both phones to the local AT&amp;T store. They confirmed that the new phone had, indeed, been blacklisted and would no longer work for anyone on any carrier. Furthermore, they said that when I put my SIM card into the blacklisted phone, AT&amp;T automatically disabled my account and I had to request it to be re-enabled.<br><br>Unacceptable. Will never buy from this supplier again.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I took my phone to a T-Mobile store and they told me that the phone was not unlocked and they could not do anything for me.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Very good refurbished phone.  Cosmetically and functionally excellent, outstanding battery life. I was delighted to find mine was not carrier branded, so it didn't have all that garbageware installed. Even better, you can turn on your mobile hotspot, which is locked on most carrier-branded phones!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Overall I am happy with the phone it works and looks really good! Just wasnt happy it came with a none working USB cord and plug or I would have given this 5 stars.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I updated this phone twice but it still said that it needs software updates.<br>It Sucks and makes me upset.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone I received was fine except the touch screen intermittently not responsive.  This phone was not going to work out for me so i returned it to only get half my refund.  No explanation as to why. Just half of what I paid for it.  Buyer beware\n</span>', '<span>\n  Bought this for my mom and its work for 2 weeks now she cant make a calls , going to return it , and not recommended for this seller .\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I always wish people put what carrier they have in these reviews so when it doesn't work we can know if it's the same carrier we have. I have cricket wireless which operates just like AT&amp;T by using a Sim Card. The description of the phone says it won't work with Verizon so make sure to check that your carrier uses a Sim Card.<br><br>My phone was unlocked and ready to go! It came just like a brand new phone and asked me to go through all the prompts to set it up. While it's a refurbished phone, I honestly don't even know what they fixed. It feels brand new and works great! It's very fast and I haven't found a single thing wrong with it. After buying this phone I will never buy a new one again. It was a great price and I'm very happy with it!<br><br>I also wanted to add that I did a lot of research between the S8 and the S9. From what I can find online you don't get a significant upgrade between the two so save your money and grab yourself one of these S8's! The next big upgrade is the S10 and it's a lot more expensive. For what I use my phone for (texting, browsing FB and IG, Taking Photos, running 2 businesses) the S8 works perfectly and fits all my needs.<br><br>Update: I've had this phone since February and still works perfectly!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  So, I really LOVE this phone and I've always purchased certified refurbished phones. However, you definitely want to be careful, because you never know what you are going to get until you've gotten it. I've never had any issues until this particular time when I got an unexpected surprise upon opening the package...a big fat scratch right in the middle of the screen. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because you barely see the scratch on the screen when it's lit up. But it was a huge disappointment that's for sure!\n</span>""]"

Coming from the s10+, I was worried that I would be completely disappointed. The s20fe feels premium despite having a plastic back. This is due to its thickness and weight. The plastic feels premium and the cloud mint doesn't leave visible fingerprints. The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person. Yes... the 1080p display looks fine. You will not be able to tell the difference unless you get a magnifying glass or put your eye right up to the display. If you are coming from the s8 or and older phone, this phone is worth picking up.<br><br>*Update, I'm really satisfied with the performance of the phone. Battery life with the 120hz screen is acceptable and can still last the whole day with moderate use. The rear camera is nice but the front facing camera leaves more to be desired. The performance is definitely there with the Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of ram. I used to use a phone with 8gb of ram and I don't notice a difference (I always have multiple apps open). My original opinion still stands. There have also been reports of touchscreen issues. This has not affected me. Samsung sent out an update to correct this issue for those who had it.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I bought this phone because I wasn't willing to spend a grand on the S20/ or note. Plus on Amazon it saved me an extra 100. I have tmobile. And I switched my sim out from my S9. Phone calls and texting worked immediately but it took me a couple hours to get the mobile data running. But after I restarted the network I am now on 5G.<br>I did not receive my headset. I reached out to Amazon and I'll see what they say. If not I'll reach out to Samsung. This phone is larger than my S9 but I love the screen size even though it's not easy to hold for me with one hand. It is a beautiful phone. Screen has amazing color. And it is quite fast. Downer is the battery life. I've been on it for a couple hours and I'm down to 62% but it did charge really fast. From what I did see of the camera in low light the picture did come out nice for being at night. 3 different settings are on upon opening it. Zoom back, regular and zoom in. I'll see what the pictures look like in the day. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Just hope that the battery life gets fixed. It's a nice alternative for getting a new phone at a not so large price tag.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Just Got My Samsung Galaxy S20 FE yesterday and I open and tested it if it is a good phone....it is a nice looking phone, but the problem is it was heating up and drained the battery to fast.....only 4/5 hrs of use time at fully  charge!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.<br><br>The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.<br><br>Doesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.<br><br>I'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Never again will I buy another Samsung phone.  My Galaxy S8+ is superior in every way except 5G.  This phone reeks internal design contest by 1st year interns.  Goodbye Samsung.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.<br><br>The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.<br><br>At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.<br><br>But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.<br><br>From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.<br><br>It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  \xa0This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn't affected, but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week.\n</span>""]"

My wife's S8+ that was close to becoming non-functional and I needed a new phone asap.  I had previously purchased an A20s for my son and so I first ordered the A30s until I did some research regarding my mobile provider T-Mobile in the US.<br><br>I cancelled the A30s and got the A51 primarily because of the supported LTE bands. T-Mobile uses the following bands<br>2, 4, 5, 12, 66, 71<br>The A30s only supports band 5 from the that list!<br>However, the A51 supports band 2, 4, 5, 12 and 66.  I was gladly willing to pay a little more to ensure I had maximum connectivity with my carrier so I cancelled the A30s and purchased the A51 instead.<br><br>Now with that primary consideration out of the way, on to the rest of the review.  I'll start with the best parts first.<br><br>1.  Call quality, reception and connectivity<br>The call quality is excellent on this phone, right up there with my s10+.  I think the microphone quality has been improved because my wife loves using the speakerphone and on her hold s8+, her voice occasionally cut out here and there as the mic tried to pick up her voice.  Also, the sound quality of the voice has improved as well which further helps to understand the conversation.  Reception has been about the same compared to my s10+, which is to say pretty good.  We measured on signel strength and asu.  The mobile data speeds are excellent even in areas that are typically weaker in signal strength.<br><br>2.  Screen<br>Samsung AMOLEDs are the best in the business when it comes to screen quality.  We are a little relieved the screen is not curved because this allows us to get a robust case to protect everything.  The colors, quality and resolution are all indistuingishable compared to my s10+.  The front camera is a tiny pinhole so the entire body is pretty much all screen.  There is an in-screen fingerprint reader which is optical, rather than infrasonic on my s10+ but it is still reasonably fast to unlock the phone.  Yes it is slightly slower than my s10+ but we're talking milliseconds of difference.<br><br>3.  General usability<br>My wife is not a gamer so I can't say anything about the gaming experience but she does use a ton of media and productivity apps.  For all of her use on them so far, she says they feel snappy.  They all open fast and transition well and she multitasks as much as before without a shred of difference.  When we first setup the phone, we were concerned because there was some UI lag but realized a lot of processing was being used during the Samsung Switch, which transfered her entire old phone to the new phone.  Once the switch was done, we rebooted and the phone was responsive and fast.<br><br>4.  Camera<br>The camera hardware has some beefy specs.  But for a mostly point-and-shooter, it's hard to really go wrong many camera setups.  Picture quality looks great in the light and not as good in the dark compared to my s10+.  The slower camera speed is noticeable, transitioning between the main camera/wide/macro takes about a half second, where on my s10+ is pretty much instant.  The shutter is just as fast, luckily.  If camera speeds are important to you, you would probably not be happy with this phone.<br><br>5.  Battery<br>I have to admit, we were looking forward to getting more usable time out of the battery.  The battery is 4000mah unit and the s8+ was only 3500mah.  However, through the typical daily use, we found that the end-of-day percentage left were about the same.  We average about 4 hours of on-screen time scattered throughout the day with app use and web-browsing and the battery was around 40% left, which is the same as the s8+.  If long battery life is important to you, you would not be happy with this phone but keep in mind, it can easily last an entire busy day on a single charge.<br><br>Overall, we like the phone for the price of under $300.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  LTE working on T-Mobile in US with Mint mobile, after configuring APN!<br><br>Great budget phone with a fantastic screen and pretty decent camera, and enough ram for the typical person.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I researched this exact model and every website says that this model comes with NFC, but it doesn\'t. I noticed a customer ask the question if this model has NFC and it seems it was the seller who said it does have NFC. This phone is an international phone and it has some things in the settings that are in Spanish when I chose ""English"" in the setup. This phone also came with Android Auto preinstalled, but there is no way to open the app. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn\'t help either. Not pleased that this phone doesn\'t have NFC and the fact it has software bugs and it cost me $300 before tax. There are other phones out there for a lower price and even better specs. Not sure if will buy another Samsung phone after this experience.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I'm happy with my purchase however I received the wrong color I ordered the black one but I do find the blue pretty so I'll be keeping it...phone works excellent on cricket wireless in Pennsylvania...I will recommend this phone.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Got the phone, 4 gig ram, might not be a such thing as 6 gig .

And be jealous of my green laser gun.<br><br>Service Provider: STRAIGHT TALK<br>Apple only user (7 years)<br><br>BACKGROUND: My iPhone 5s went to poo 💩(For the second time in 7 years I lost an iPhone). Each time the ""geniuses"" told me my phone was not repairable and I had to buy a new phone.  AND both times it was the charge connector that just went completely crap one day.  Great.  Looking back I guess I was part of the many brainwashed sheep with the one track mind thinking Apple leads all.  But in reality, they are stuck in neutral.  Since they lost Steve Jobs, no one has stepped up to be that Willy Wonka of cutting edge ideas and showmanship.  And its blatantly obvious to me now.  Oh and guess what?  They now make the headphones use the same failure prone adapter on all new iPhones (meaning you cannot wire charge and listen to headphones), so I finally decided to stop eating rotten Apples.  And I decided to Hitchhike a Ride on a Galaxy S9.  Now I know you\'ll say a 5s is older and its comparing apples and oranges (that pun was unintentional🤮...my apoligies), but my friend has an iPhone X and let me try it.  It wasn\'t that much different of an Apple experience.  And it was 400 more than this phone. (I apologize for my overt digressions, but phones are a huge investment and I try to make my reviews thorough and whatever the perfect opposite of boring is...I hope.)<br><br>Day 1:  I\'m really $%@!$&amp; nervous.  Did I make the right decision?  I\'m a textbook overthinker.  I went without a phone for 9 days trying to decide.  And here I am.  Waiting on a refurbished Galaxy S9.  Finally Delivered.  First box is the typical smaller Amazon box.  Second inside is a small white box. Very simple worry-free packaging.  Inside that box was the phone, A/C adaptor, charge cord, and a paper with quickstart and APN help.  Also a card from Amazon saying contact the seller first with a problem blah blah Charlie Brown teacher voice blah blah blah.  So I have made a few certified refurbished electronic purchases in the past and they worked out great, so I was not as apprehensive as maybe a refurb greenhorn might be.  But listen.  Phone is in hand now.  And this phone is stunning.  Immaculate.  I went over it and it looks COMPLETELY brand new.  The screen is perfect.  Don\'t be afraid.  Jump in the water.  Buy refurbished.  Ok...so here is my first negative, but its petty really.  I bought the ""lilac"" colored phone because I love light colored purples like lilac and lavender.  Only this isn\'t really either.  I\'d call this more of a pinker color with a hint of purple, but its still sleek and nice and can be covered up with a case if needed. Ok so physical condition out of the box I\'d give a solid grade A+  Now for the SIM card.  Again I am a Straight Talk user (looooove them...4 years strong now).  My iPhone has been tanked and off for about 9 days.  I popped out the SIM card from the rotten phone, popped out the Samsung SIM tray and dropped in the SIM, pushing the tray back flush.  Powered the phone on.  Without going through every single step, the setup was so easy and seamless.  It automatically found my service provider, so I would say this is pretty much as close to plug and play as you can get.  So awesome.  I am falling hard like Pete for Ariana for this phone...<br><br>Well...I\'ve been playing with the phone for a few hours now.  I cannot put it down.  So many things are infinitely better than Apple.  I\'m going to list a few and stop the review for Day 1.  And if you made it this far, peace and love neighbor.  Happy phone hunting.  You\'re beautiful🌞🌜⛱🌚🌟<br>1. Customization:  THEMES! I can\'t stop trying these out. They change the sounds and wallpapers and App icons and probably other cool stuff I don\'t realize all at once.  They are so cool.  Text messages look different.  And the wallpapers can be animated.  Lock screens can be videos.  I am admittedly geeking a little. Android systems let you change soooooooo much.  And I am a customization freak.  Not only can you choose from hundreds of free and paid themes on the Google Play store, but you can choose from so many different fonts as well (and you can choose from tons for free and money the same way).  You can set the order of so many things, it\'s just the coolest.  Oh and here is a great one.  For the OCD users like me, who hated when you couldn\'t delete an apple app, you still have those on Android you cannot delete as well.  BUT YOU CAN HIDE THEM!<br><br>2. The button clicks are addictive.  It feels like you are pushing a button when its the bare screen.  I have a screen protector on AND and phone case and it\'s still extremely responsive.<br><br>3. The swiping motions aren\'t that different from Apple.  I\'m navigating like a pro.  I\'m sure there are how-to videos I need to watch to learn all of the shortcuts, but I\'m doing just fine.<br><br>Ok.  Enough for now.  I\'m jonesing to play with the phone waaaaaay more.  Ask any questions you want.  I will answer all I can. I will update this review as I see the need.<br>Peace and Love,<br>The Muffin Man\n</span>', '<span>\n  I will be utmost honest here. This is my first device review. I was hesitant to order a Certified Refurbished phone. Especially since it is...a phone. The meat and bone of daily life and communication. However, upon receiving the phone, everything was inside a white uniform box. Nothing special and nothing damaged at all. Simplistic and efficient packaging. The phone works great and no one can tell it isn\'t ""Brand new"". Absolutely no scratches or signs it has been touched by another human. 10/10 item and you save 100$ in the process by getting refurbished! I am switching from an iPhone 6 to this S9 on ATnT. Simply pull the SIM out and insert into s9 and you are ready to go.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone itself worked really well and was brand new and has no scratches. Unfortunately it was not truly unlocked and connected to the sprinit network and was not able to change over to verizon. I had to send back but again only because it was not unlocked.  The phone itself was good.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I have not ever written a review but thought this would be helpful after I read the reviews and was a little wary of the unlocked feature.  Some have had problems when putting the SIM card in from a different carrier.  I had the same problem and felt helpless when the Sprint logo launched on my phone when I turned it on.  So after much searching I found sites to send me unlocked codes for a fee of about $50 and thought about it.  (The ""unlock"" feature can apply to international carriers but may still be ""locked"" to a certain carrier).  Sprint will unlock the phone for free if the prior bill and the phone have been paid as well as the phone being used for at least 50 days.  So I called Sprint to get the code and found out that the phone was unlocked on their system.  I didn\'t need to put in a new code.  I then called ATT and after setting up some menus, I was good to go.  The only hassle I have now is a notification that the phone cannot connect to the Sprint network.  It sits it the top bar when I scroll through the other notifications but is not intrusive.  So outside of doing the above legwork, I\'m happy with the phone (4 days in).  It just should be made more clear about the phone truly being unlocked from the carrier and what needs to be done to get on to another network.  It makes it feel a little deceptive in the advertising without this information\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I was kind of nervous buying a refurbish device. After taking a chance and receiving the device, I am grateful I took that chance. So I am posting this review to ease anyone's reservation you may have. My fiance love it!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Phone was NOT unlocked and had a defective screen, which kept changing colors (as if the blue light filter was on).\n</span>', ""<span>\n  About a month after the return window closed, the phone started to randomly shut down and restart.  I did a factory reset hoping that would fix it, but unfortunately, it did not.  There has been a slight improvement (i.e., less restarts), but I'm still having problems.  I'll be taking it into the Sprint store to see if there is anything they can do, but my advice right now would be to pay the extra money for a non-refurbished phone.<br><br>Very disappointed.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I should have read the other reviews.  This is not a truly unlocked phone.  It works with my ATT simcard but I get an annoying notification that it can't connect to Sprint and I cannot access visual voicemail.  The charging cable provided looks like it came from a gas station and that it would probably harm the phone.  Although they said it may be a generic charger, i did expect one somewhat in the same neighborhood of quality as the factory charger.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Arrived super early, before tracking could even report it\'s movements<br>Appears to be perfect; minor hair scratches on the screen, seems to have a screen cover on it already, minor charging port scratches, crystal back, truly a gorgeous color even if I\'m just going to put a cover on it<br><br>Not sure if this is an s9 thing or not, relatively heavy pressure needed to engage the touch screen (like typing or moving tiles). Changed the sensitivity to ""screen protector"" setting, MUCH better.<br><br>Came in a plain white plastic envelope with a bubble-pack USPS flat-rate envelope inside that with a plain white box inside that. Wrapped in a bubble sheet inside the box. Very protected!<br><br>Not the original charger.<br><br>UPDATE: The charger is crap quality - I advise using literally any other charger. It made an alarming electrical buzz when I plugged it in and it proceeded to blow up the test battery I had spare.<br>UPDATE: Screen protector that was on it caused the heavy pressure - new screen protector is a dream.<br>UPDATE: Woohoo! It works with AT&amp;T.<br>UPDATE: Can confirm it\'s unlocked internationally, I\'m in Japan with a Japanese SIM card :)\n</span>', '<span>\n  Unlocked doesn\'t mean any phone any provider.  After reading some reviews that has issues with an unlocked phone I wanna help explain. First check with your provider.  The description box here says its compatible with GSM carriers. In the US that\'s AT&amp;T, T-moblie &amp; other smaller brands are GSM such as Straight Talk.<br><br> Sprint, Verizon, US Cellular uses CDMA. These typically can\'t be crossed even with an unlocked phone. You either use GSM or CDMA.<br>Just check with your provider (I Googled it) then cross check the description box.<br>Note : it\'s easier to swap phones on GSM networks. GSM carriers must accept ANY GSM compliant phone.<br>I don\'t know much about the CDMA but I read online ""CDMA means you can only switch with your carriers permission &amp; they don\'t have to accept any phone into their network.""<br><br>This seller deserves 5 stars in my opinion  or at least shouldn\'t be given a bad review/low stars bc the phone isn\'t compatible. That has nothing to do with the product yet it effects the seller.<br><br> It\'s a matter of reading the description box &amp; comparing with your carrier. The product itself is thru the roof amazing!<br><br> Again any GSM phone and GSM provider will absolutely work without a doubt.<br><br> I had to take the time and give this product a review. I was extremely skeptical about ordering a refurbished anything but I didn\'t wanna spend $1k. Now I\'m so thankful I gave this a shot. It comes with a warranty which made me feel better. I felt like I would know in this time frame if it was worth keeping.<br> My Samsung Galaxy 9 looks brand spanking new. The battery lasts forever. The camera is amazing. Everything functions perfectly. I couldn\'t be happier. This was my first electroic purchase online &amp; because of how amazing this experience is it gives me more confidence about ordering other devices in the future. There literally isn\'t even a scratch. I have Straight Talk &amp; I\'ve been with them many years. In fact I got with them when they were just starting. Anywho, I purchased a bring your own phone sim card from Amazon and my phone was working in matter of minutes.<br>I had a Galaxy 6 and even transferring my info from one phone to the new one was seamless. To the sellers thank you!!! I love my phone so so so much!\n</span>']"

She was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen.

But they wouldn't last more than 2 years. My husband got A51 recently. Then I came across this one which was $60 cheaper. And I find no difference between the two. Same speed and storage capacity. I am very happy with my purchase, Definitely recommend this if you are on low budget. I am hoping it would last me more than 2 years easily.\n</span>""]"

The 5 was $100 more ($699) than Amazon's price of S20 FE of $599 at release (*S20 FE now $699) with the 5 using processing power of a few generations back with smaller battery capacity - this was a no brainer choice and Google over priced their flagship (I understand their camera is generally good and updates faster/ui cleaner - but that's not making up for everything else especially considering competition from this phone and OnePlus among others).<br><br>It's still brand new so time will tell a lot more but the phone is snappy and my wifi &amp; cell signal are faster than my Honor View 10 that's being replaced. I use T-mobile and not in a 5G area yet (but one is close by I'll be able to test). I attached a pic of my speed test info on cell network. The bottom 2 similar results are default with 5G enabled in the cellular settings and the top (fastest) results is with the second option of 4G LTE/3/2 enabled. I thankfully read a post to disable 5G if not in network for one. My old phone would only get 25 download on average so the S20 FE has blown that away even at its worst.<br><br>I took a photo in an average edge lit room of some colored items and a pic in a very low light room (any light coming in is from a room at least 10ft away).

I checked the description back and found it have been changed from 8 GB to 6 GB. This is so weird.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  The screen on this phone will randomly stop accepting touch inputs and then at other points it will click when trying to scroll or scroll up when lifting your finger. Looking at online forums, this seems to be a common problem with this particular phone from Samsung. Seems like they tried to cut some corners to get the price down while still advertising the 120hz display and it didn't work out well. Not sure if it's something that can be fixed with a software update but it wasn't corrected as of the October 2020 OTA update. Not going to chance waiting around for a fix and being outside the return window. If you are experiencing odd behavior with your screen and touch sensitivity, you're not alone. Bummer as well because otherwise I loved the phone.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Found out my phone also has the touch screen issue others are complaining about. Tested it with Touch Screen Test app, instruction is on Youtube. Two finger swipe causes criss-cross pattern. Jittery and unresponsive swipe action when scrolling through websites. If software issue it can eventually be fixed, but not going to wait around to find out that it's a hardware issue. Returning the phone after one hour of use. Guess Samsung cut a critical corner while trying to reduce the cost of the FE version.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.<br><br>The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.<br><br>The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won\'t even notice the plastic back.<br><br>The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.<br><br>The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.<br><br>The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don\'t have to worry about this bug.<br><br>The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don\'t even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won\'t work if you don\'t have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn\'t a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.<br><br>The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I\'m glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.<br><br>This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I sold my s20 ultra and bought this. No issues so far everything works great. I now have extra money to buy something else.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This phone seemed like it had it all for an unbeatable price of $550. Big battery, 120 hz, good cameras, recent cpu, and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn't something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don't mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I'm still looking myself. Good luck!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I just got the S20FE today and it looks pretty good so far, but the description on Amazon is pretty inaccurate.<br><br>This does NOT have 8gb RAM, only 6gb.

So if you don't have Bluetooth headphones, you're out of luck, or will still need to go buy a pair.<br><br>Customer service also did not help, the only solution is to return for a refund.

I was excited to try this phone, but it was immediately disappointing. To begin, this phone was absolutely not 'like new'. There were several obvious scratches on both the screen and back case. The phone was packaged in generic packaging with generic cables (which I expected and am fine with.) When I began setting up the phone I was immediately halted... no sim card tray! Contacted the seller with no response. Had to look for a replacement flamingo pink sim card tray, which as you can imagine, was difficult and would not arrive for over a week rendering the phone useless. Landed on ordering a black one in the interim to at least test the phone. After waiting to get the tray, the phone worked very well. Not flawless, but very well. Google account and Samsung app worked mostly (no contact picture transfer). Battery lasts much longer than the galaxy s7 it replaced. Software runs marginally better and faster. Camera hardware and software is a big upgrade. Facial recognition is nice, and the fingerprint works exactly the same. The only issue is that the fingerprint sensor is embedded in the screen and the screen protector (specifically purchased as fingerprint sensor friendly) interferes with its operation.  Screen is much nicer and larger than old phone.<br><br>Overall, this is a very nice phone for a good price. I knocked it down a star for the complete lack of communication, as well as it clearly not being 'like new'. The second negative star is because of the sellers ineptitude.

Probably would not purchase again... def would not recommend.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I was a little nervous about ordering this based on some of the reviews here, but Amazon lets you return if there's a problem so it was relatively low risk.

I did some digging about why this could have been happening and it turns out there are “copy” iPhone screens that don’t preform the same way iPhone screens do for example I had my e-cig (puff bar) in my hand and accidentally tapped the screen and it responded. I tried the same with my girlfriends iPhone 8 Plus and nothing happened then I tried it with my work phone 8 plus nothing again which was concerning. So I looked at them all together with the same settings and picture and the quality is definitely sufficiently lower and then I locked them all to see the lcd’s I found there is a very noticeable green tint on the one I bought. So all and all it’s a fake screen real iPhone unlocked which may or may not delete every photo from your cloud or buy everything on amazon.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This phone looks almost new and everything works great except for the camera.  The camera works fine as a camera but when you use the camera in any installed app it goes in and out of focus like something is blocking it.  Very strange... now I either deal with it or return since it's a week old so it's just frustrating at this point because I've cleared my older phone but may have to load it back so I have a device to use.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Love my iPhone 8plus! Could not connect to boost mobile. Connected to metro pcs works great\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I purchased this refurbished iPhone 8 Plus for $340 and for the value of the phone it was too high. I have always been highly skeptical when purchasing electronics online because you never actually know what you're getting, but with the pandemic I really had no other choice. When the phone first arrived, everything was working fine until a few days later after playing videos on Youtube I realized that the speakers on the bottom left were not working AT ALL. I was surprised that a seller on Amazon would sell an iPhone 8 Plus for $340 with BAD speakers.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I bought this thinking I was going to get a brand new phone because that’s the option chose at check out however when I got it it had dirt caked in the bottom speakers and the front speaker is broken so I can only talk on the phone if it’s on speaker or if I use my air pods. I checked the battery life when I first set it up and the battery life was at 81%. I don’t think it’s worth the money and I should of just got a brand new one considering if I wanted to get the front speaker fixed I would of just spent the same amount on a even newer version of an I phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I LOVE THIS PHONE! It came with no scratches or marks and super clean. When I unboxed it had a key for my SIM card slot and my phone has a glass screen protector already on it. Put my Straight Talk SIM card in and immediately got service. Couldn’t have asked for a better phone! Perfect condition and was worth every penny!\n</span>', '<span>\n  We have bought 2 phones off here BUT this third one really broke us!! It does NOT have the apple emblem on the back ... it worked fine for 2 days now it freezes up.... we are NOT impressed at ALL!!\n</span>']"

It constantly hunts for focus, causing 50% of all photos taken destined for the trash. Videos, despite the 8k support, are just abysmal. Why, you may ask? Samsung chose to use a single lens auto focus, instead of a dual lens focus found in every other modern smart phone. Even the Galaxy S20+ has a dual lens, so I'm a bit miffed at their decision to do so on this model. This is not only a critical failure on Samsung's part, but a crime to charge $1,400 for. This phone has next gen capabilities with first gen technical problems, all for a price double to triple that of a superior last gen model.<br><br>For all those waiting on Samsung's promised update, hoping it'll fix the issue, it's NOT coming! The auto focus problem is a HARDWARE issue! This CANNOT be fixed with an update. If you're looking for a next gen (even current gen) capable smart phone camera, look elsewhere.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Its about time. Bundle is an amazing option because i miss pre orders. Also, it's finally compatible with all phone services in America. T MOBILE, VERIZON, ATT. Phone is amazing. 120hz screen. Biggest battery.

Just to be clear these come with the regular galaxy buds and not the +\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The camera is absolutely horrible. I simply can't believe Samsung released this phone with a camera this bad touting how amazing it supposed to be.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Yes, I have the latest update installed &amp; still have focusing issues. This $1400 S20 Ultra is going back to Amazon for a REFUND. The Display is nice but the camera is WAY overrated &amp; the S20 Ultra camera software is TRASH&gt;&gt;&gt;NO ""APERTURE"" MODE?????? Samsung, WHAT were you thinking??????

To me, the photos are just marginally better than my Pixel3.  I do like the longer battery life. I'm probably not buying another flagship at release ever again.  We're reached the point of dominishing returns with phones and features.<br><br>3 months later and  I still maintain the same sentiment. I want my money back. There's so many bugs and flaws in this over priced paper weight\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  OK, so I have read some frankly dumb reviews on places like Android Central.  It's huge!  Heavy!  Too big for my pocket!  Oh give it a rest.  It's just not that much bigger than the Note 10.  Too heavy?  Really?  It weighs a few ounces.  Wear lighter shoes or something.<br><br>Anyway, this phone is typical Samsung - or anyone elses flagship - phone.  What sets it apart is the camera.  It is the most capable camera on any phone to date.  The Pixel 4 comes close.  Nothing else does.  Pixel 4 is a little better in fact.  Until you start reaching for the long shots.  Or the wide angle shots.  Then the thing just shines.<br><br>I also read a review complaining that depth of field is too shallow close up.  Well, switch to pro mode and stop the aperture down.  It's not the cameras fault you don't know how to use it.<br><br>In the hands of someone who understands how cameras work, this thing is amazing.  Not perfect, no.  But amazing.  It takes shots you cannot take with any other phone.  You are going to pay for that.  The lens array is huge.  It has to be.  It's expensive.  OK, so?  You don't get bleeding edge for free.<br><br>So, how about that 5G, huh?  Ahahahaaaaaaahahahaaaaa, not around me, no.  No 5G.  So that's useless.  But the screen is huge and beautiful.  Battery runs more or less forever.  Camera is generally the best on any phone.  No comparison.  iPhone and Pixel have some catchup to do.  They have both already lost the display race. to Samsung.<br><br>If the camera is important, pony up.  There isn't much choice.  You will not regret it.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  \xa0Receive everything i pre-ordered, earbuds,wireless charger and phone.<br>Just receive Update/fix today 3/21/20 on US Boost Mobile,but the auto focus issues continue,that specific update has nothing to deal with the camera issue.<br>Update:<br>Just receive 2 updates 1 for security and 1 for camera app,phone working way much better 👍.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Really love this phone!! The camera is amazing and I got this photo of a yellow finch that landed on my car windshield! Zoom is awesome and the phone is super easy to use (coming from a Google Pixel so it's a little different). Beware of Amazon though, make sure you know as soon as it shows up at your house...my Amazon delivery driver put on there that it was handed directly to a resident. It absolutely was not. I was sitting in my living room waiting for it and heard a car door, so I went out to look and my phone was sitting right out on the porch. There had been no knock or anything! I also watched the driver take off out of my driveway with the side of his van wide open...not professional at all. Glad I was home and checking the app constantly or my phone could've been stolen!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was adamit to spend this kind of money on a phone since i am on a small budget. but i did i bit the bullit and well it was well worth it. a lot of people say the 100x zoom sucks and was crap well after the updates and learning how to use it right with a tripod or a steady hand and clearing the phones cash and the cameras cash after the update. it works great yes the photos will be a little degraded but its not much if you look at a zoomed in photo at 100 x the quality is of a cheaper camera is all. I also am a tech person in a way and i love to see what phones can do what they have in them and so on. so i ran the softwear to see the heardwear specs. and to find to my amaze the 108 mp camera is suposto have 5x optical but useing the phone i thought it was odd it could be no difference is clearity at 10  x even with hybred and well shure enough the phone has a 10x optical zoom from what the heardwear readout shows and it makes cents looking at the photos of it online. now i do thing some things can be fixed in the feture with updates and the image can be made clearer but rember this is the first camera of its kind and they have to work the kinks out. and while i will not be opening this phone i do no one thing you can do with more phones but will not work with a lense that has optical zoom and that is adjust it manuley. i also love that this phone can do true full black night vision useing the tof night vision viewer app from the play store. this phone was well worth it. if you look at just what the cameras in the phone can do and you buy cheap cameras to mach this in real life you would spend thousends just a cheap night vision camera will cost you $1000 and around that for a 30x 108 mp camera.\n</span>']"

Just ordered an OTTERBOX from their website, 20% less than on Amazon with free shipping.<br><br>Hope this helpful, great phone\n</span>', '<span>\n  I bought this phone for many of the reasons B. Rodgers cited in his thorough review. The phone is bigger and much heavier than what I expected [ UPDATE: but I got used to the bigger size and weight].<br><br>Flagship phones are designed for obsolescence and cost twice as much. They have sealed-in batteries that typically fail after 2 years, and usually only promise 1-2 years of security updates. Since the Xcover Pro has Android 10 from the factory, it reportedly can support more thorough or lasting updates than Android 9 phones. The Xcover Pro guarantees 3-4 years of security updates, and has a 24-month warranty, whereas most phones offer only 12 month warranties and maybe 1 OS update.<br><br>The battery can be swapped out before a new work shift, and swapped out at the end of its useful life, using only our bare hands. This phone is rugged, water resistant, and has good cameras; other phones with removable batteries have no water-resistance, low-end processors, and low-end cameras. I don\'t want to contribute to electronic waste, so I chose a phone that is designed to last. The ultra-wide-angle camera seems to cover about 135 degrees, so you can stand in a room corner and fit the whole room into the frame.<br><br>It has a left-side button that can be assigned to any two apps via a long press or short press, and a top button that can be assigned to launch any two apps. The right-side power button can also be assigned, and I don\'t have to lift the phone off the desk to use the fingerprint reader that is built into the right-side power button.<br><br>* Dictation without the cloud<br>This phone can convert speech to text internally, without sending your voice to the cloud. I confirmed this by dictating text into apps while holding the right-side button, even when I had the phone in airplane mode.<br><br>* Wi-Fi calling<br>I need Wi-Fi calling so I can place and receive calls without paying exorbitant roaming fees when I travel, while using my regular phone number. Although Samsung reassured me that all their phones including this one support WI-Fi calling, after purchase Samsung support told me that Wi-Fi calling requires cell-carrier bloatware baked into the phone\'s firmware. Consequently, if you want this phone to have Wi-Fi calling, the only option is to get a carrier version. In the US it is only Verizon, so you will have to put up with the worst customer service I have experienced in years, or purchase the phone from Verizon then use it on another network.<br><br>* Point Of Sale (POS) transactions:<br>Samsung claims that this is the only phone with EMV Level-1 compatibility: ""You can now accept payments without the need for additional hardware. The Galaxy XCover Pro has EMV Level-1 that makes it mPOS-ready."" However, the Xcover Pro does NOT have MST (Magnetic Secure Transfer) hardware, and therefore does not support Samsung Pay for paying at point of sale (POS) locations.<br><br>Samsung claims I can use Google Pay, but I have not tried that, as I do not want Google to log every transaction I make with my phone. Unlike other payment systems, Samsung Pay uses MST hardware on their most popular phones to make credit card transactions compatible with all POS magnetic strip readers.<br><br>The phone does have NFC payment, which works only on POS systems that support NFC. So Ironically, the XCover Pro has more capabilities for accepting payments from other credit cards, but fewer capabilities for making payments with your own credit card due to lack of MST hardware.<br><br>This unlocked Xcover Pro has powered down for no apparent reason, and self-reset numerous times. I don\'t know if that\'s due to any of my installed apps, though they were working fine on my older &amp; slower Samsung phone. I\'m returning this phone and trying my luck with the Verizon version because Wi-Fi calling is essential to me. The Verizon XCover Pro is not self-resetting, but I have not yet allowed it to install the latest OS update, so I don\'t know if that will cause the resets.<br><br>*** UPDATE on 2020-07-25: ***<br>I purchased the $500 Verizon XCover Pro with a $200 discount to be credited monthly over 24 months, and an additional $200 credit on my first Verizon bill for porting my phone number to a Verizon Enterprise account. Obtaining a new account from Verizon was so aggravating I\'m not sure it will be worth the savings.<br>1) As far as I know my Verizon XCover Pro has not self-reset. I\'ve had it for almost two months. I suppose I should restart the phone.<br>2) If anyone has conclusively been able to get this unlocked XCover Pro to work with Wi-Fi calling, please reply to this review and let us know. Samsung told me Wi-Fi calling is not possible on an unlocked phone.<br>3) If you have been able to get this phone at a discount from Verizon on a personal account, let us know.<br>4)  Unsurprisingly, Verizon\'s custom bloatware on the Verizon version of the XCover Pro disabled the built-in FM radio. Carriers do this to push us into their data plan. So no emergency radio reception for when the towers are down or out of reach, and no radio feed without a data plan on the Verizon version.<br>5) The FM radio on this unlocked phone was not disabled. However, I could not get FM radio reception using  the NextRadio app (all I heard was noise) even though reception was great on my nearby Android tablet using the same wired earphones as an antenna. Does the FM radio work on your XCover Pro? You you can install the NextRadio app and use wired earphones as an antenna.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I like this phone a lot.  I got this to replace a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active.  That six year old phone was the most trouble-free phone I've ever owned going all the way back to the mid-1990s.  I've been hard on it, but it still looks like a brand new phone.  I was reluctant to give it up, but the battery was giving out, the phone was spending a lot of time tethered to the charger, and the case is sealed so it's not easy to change the battery.  I decided to go with a new phone instead.<br><br>The Xcover PRO is actually a lot larger and heavier than I was expecting, but I'm getting used to it.  I unboxed the phone, put the battery in it and charged it up.  It took about 90 minutes for a full charge.  Transferring my old apps and contacts to the new phone was painless and was over in mere minutes.  I plugged in the SIM card and made a few calls on it.  It works fine on AT&amp;T.  Battery life appears to be excellent.  I still have more than 50% at the end of the day, so I could probably get through a second day at work without having to recharge.  The camera gets some great shots.  I love the combo side key/fingerprint reader.  It's the perfect place to put it... right on the unlock button.<br><br>Nothing too mysterious about this phone.  It took me a little while to puzzle out where the SD card plugs in.  Get a magnifying glass and look for the legend stamped in the case next to the SIM slot.<br><br>The only minor gripe is that some of the stuff that this page says comes with the phone wasn't in the box I got.  It was all just minor stuff, so it didn't prevent me from using the phone, but I'll include it here so that the seller can correct their information on this page (or if it is correct, maybe they could just send the stuff to me).  Here's their full list:<br><br>Handset  Included<br>Travel Adapter  Included<br>Data Cable (also for charging)  Included<br>Headset  Included<br>Sim Card Ejection Pin  NOT Included<br>Rechargeable Battery  Included<br>USB Connector  ???

You'll also want to read the real manual which is available on line<br>Terms &amp; Conditions/ Health &amp; Safety Guide  Included\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Edit: I was able to find batteries for this phone from a retailer in the Netherlands which now makes this phone a 5.<br>----<br>The removable battery is what made me spring for this phone.  It's the feature I care about most.  I bet that if you've stumbled upon this review you also care a great deal for this feature and don't want to get suckered in to buying a phone that needs to be replaced every 2 years.<br><br>I have no complaints about the phone at all - it provides the perfect blend of functionality, performance and practicality the market has to offer at the moment.<br><br>Despite this, the killer feature of this phone cannot be experienced if its removable batteries are not made available and at a reasonable price if/when they are.  The battery (GH43-04993A) appears to be available outside the US.  It is hopefully just a matter of time before they're available here.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  While every online spec sheet lists FM radio, and this phone does have an FM chip, Samsung for whatever reason decided **not** to include an FM tuner app and the Next Radio app on the play store doesn't work.  So, if you we're buying this for hiking and wanted the FM radio (like me), you shouldn't buy this. From what I can tell Europe and Australia / New Zealand all ship with the FM tuner app.  Thanks for nothing Samsung!  $#) '/' %=/!?\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Have had this phone for a about a month now. Works great and takes perfectly fine photos, BTW (better than what I had from Samsung four years ago). It's truly rugged, and has a snappy response to the apps and functions. The mono-speaker is just fine as a speakerphone, too, almost too loud for my 70-year-old ears. Battery requires just one charge in the early morning and keeps going all day (YouTube vids, music, exercise app, timer, weather, solitaire/checkers/chess... and all the other power-hungry apps I use), especially with the Android 10 features helping to monitor and manage power usage. Will order a replacement battery when they are available in the U.S., which means I can keep my phone running in tip-top shape for years! Thank, you Samsung for bringing back the replaceable battery, on this phone at least! Is it the ultimate smartphone in 2020? No. But it hits the sweet spot for me: all the functions I need, a great price, and a phone that will not die when the first battery gives out.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  First off, this phone felt great in my hand, which only made the rest of my experience that much harder to accept. My whole family is on a T-Mobile plan. T-Mobile is also one of the most accessible providers in the US when it comes to BYOD (bring your own device) phones, and every ""unlocked"" phone I\'ve ever had worked with their network, except this one. Data works fine over the 4G network but it\'s when you go to make a call that things get crappy. As soon as you dial out or the phone starts to ring for an incoming call, it switches over to 3G and you get all the quality of a 20 year old technology. T-Mobile was super helpful and bumped me to higher tier tech support immediately, but soon tracked the problem down to this model not being compliant with their VoLTE system, which is because Samsung didn\'t make the phone compatible with the T-Mobile network. No option of getting a network update exists from T-Mobile, because they\'re not the ones writing that code, Samsung is.<br>Samsung\'s tech support was an embarrassing testimony to a behemoth in the cell phone world. Their business tech agent (this phone is part of their business line of devices) had almost no information in her system about this issue. In fact, the IMEI number showed up as being locked to Verizon while the phone\'s own  model number, software, and box all indicated it was an unlocked version. All the poor lady could do was recommend I go back to T-Mobile and ask them to make it work. T-Mobile also has a page where you can check to see if your device is compatible with BYOD, and entering the IMEI on that page immediately returns the message that the Xcover Pro is NOT compatible. All-in-all, the experience left me with a nasty taste for Samsung in my mouth. I sold my old phone the day before the new one arrived, but because of the incompatibility I ended up without a phone for three days, which in this day and age is horrible when you run a business and need to make and take calls, navigate to customers, and deal with emails on the run. The phone seemed great, but the experience was awful.<br>The moral of the story is that Samsung is presenting this phone both here on Amazon as well as on their own website as an unlocked phone, which it is not - at least in the generally accepted meaning of that word. It may be unlocked from Verizon, but it\'s not compatible with a lot of other carriers. A customer shouldn\'t have to actually buy the phone to test it out or check it for compatibility (you need an IMEI number in most cases to do this). This information should be clearly presented by Samsung, and it\'s their failure that it\'s not. Shame on them!<br><br>Edit to add: A lot of other reviews here mention problems with Wi-Fi calling, but I wonder whether some of the posters are confusing that with VoLTE which is like Wi-Fi calling but over the provider\'s data network. I personally did not have issues with Wi-Fi calling. It connected to my home network just fine and when connected, it used that connection for inbound and outbound calls (the LTE signal bars disappear when you\'re on a Wi-Fi network). It\'s the VoLTE part of the equation that\'s the issue with this phone on some carriers. It simply isn\'t capable of using many of the data networks for voice calls, which almost any other modern phone can do.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I have perfect service at my house with my (4 year old)  iphone through att. I thought this would be a perfect upgrade for me due to working construction and frequently exposing my phone to cold/wet/dusty conditions for work and play. I will not be able to find out if this phone is great because for whatever reason I cannot make calls or receive calls at home. If there was wifi calling option, it would be fine. It makes no sense that my old phone had perfect LTE service and this 'state of the art' $500 phone can't even let me use the most important function on the phone at home. My roommate has a galaxy 8 and gets perfect service at home as well... Sending it back\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  How I hate this phone let me count the ways:<br>1. Phone is roughly the same speed as my S7 on latest update. A definite sacrifice.<br>2. Phone doesn't support wireless charging.<br>3. No always on display; closest I could get is a clock screen saver while on charger.<br>4. And the doozy: phone is supposed to be 'waterproof', only problem is the USB port insists that phone is wet even when it couldn't possibly be, like after charging to 100% over night and waking up to see the phone says it's wet.  Now once it says it's wet you're done because it won't charge and takes typically 8 hours to 'dry'.  If you're on a mission or just on the road with maps, you're screwed.  Flush cache, restart, fan, vacuum cleaner, rice... Doesn't matter.  Yes, the phone allows you to replace the battery but who wants to do minor surgery every three hours and carry an external charger just because of a bug.<br><br>Apart from #3, which in my opinion makes the phone useless for mission critical 'activities' it works ok for someone, just not for anything I need a phone for.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Purchased the Galaxy XCover PRO to replace my Moto Force.  Great upgrade for folks like me who are confounded by the practice of buying a sleek phone then purchasing a bulky case to make it rugged enough for demands of mobile  intensive career and regular outdoor activities. After overnight charge, by EoD the XCover PRO battery still has a &gt;80% charge remaining. Factory installed screen cover is significantly more scratch resistant than Moto Force. Screen size is surprisingly large and with good clarity / visibility from viewing angles. Having a hard time imagining a better phone for folks like me who are not wanting to carry a kindle sized phablet for creating or consuming super high quality content. Great (perhaps best ever) sleek rugged every day phone.\n</span>']"

I get so mad i want to throw it, and should have just paid a few bucks more through  T mobile. I will be in the middle of a business , personal, doctor call and it will just hang up! And sometimes when i try to call back, it wont let the call through which is more frustrating! So now i have to shell out more money for one that WON'T HANG UP ON MY CALLS!  PRO'S its great for games! the battery last a looooooong time, which is great! the specs on it is really nice very clear loads pretty fast and has a lot of good features on the samsung apps! so if games is what you need it for GREAT! or doc's or downloads, but PHONES CALLS...........ITS A NO FOR ME!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Good phone, got it for my mom and I inspected it before hand, I'm sure she'll love it.

Still not thrilled that you can\'t just turn the ringer down to the point the vibration also gets shut off by using the buttons rather than going into Settings to do it.<br><br>The keypad is bigger on this phone than my old phone, so I\'m getting less typos using swype, but there are still a few that annoy me.. like ""read"" turning into ""raff"", ""the"" turning into ""there"", amongst others.<br><br>Can\'t open the back yourself to view/change the internal battery, but I think this one takes me into lithium territory as opposed to previous phones. Looks like maybe the tiny holes at the top and bottom of the case would pop the back off. Not going to try, but interesting if true.<br><br>Camera appears to be a vast improvement. Won\'t know how the speaker/microphone performs until I get a nano SIM so I can make a regular phone call.<br><br>It\'s a pretty shiny rainbow sheen blue color on the case, already smudged to death by fingerprints.<br><br>Will take a bit of getting used to having something that uses a C-USB.

Major complaint is with basic 4G reception and Wifi:  have to continually re-start phone in order to get it to sync mailboxes and other apps. Compared it to older phone on same network.  Also, display settings are problematic given the screen size, and setting them to (only a bit) larger distorts display of some e-mails and other app screens.  Home screen top display of network bars and date/hour are too tiny to read, at any age.  Better to go with a 6+ inch phone.  Read a review of camera functionality before buying, as I am not a big camera user.\n</span>', '<span>\n  If I could give this phone 20 stars I would.. absolutely top of the line phone for this price is unbeatable.

It barely lasts 12hrs on average chating and calling use.

I have always used Samsung phones and have been quite pleased. My only complaint about the S8 is battery life; it usually gets low low levels after one day of light use. I comparew this to my previous phone, a J7 prime that also has a 3000mA battery but a bigger screen. Using the same amount, the J7 was capable of 2 to 3 days' worth of battery charge; the S8 never goes beyond 1 day. otherwise, the S8 is good.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  My phone came quickly, I thought I was buying new. It looks new, but by the packaging you could tell it is renewed. It seems to be working well. Being familiar with the Samsung line, it was easy to transition to. I don't use the fingerprint reader, so I can't comment on that. The battery life for me is good for a whole day. The touchscreen  has a curved edge which will take a little getting used to. Over all I am pleased with this phone.\n</span>""]"

It\'s interesting that in 2020, a ""budget"" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren\'t as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than  ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I\'m not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeeze  in a few hours from the next day if I really can\'t get to another charger. If I have a day off and I\'m on the phone for hours,  I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it\'s hit or miss sometimes. I have found that  if I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily.  I just never thought I\'d miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing.  The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you\'re coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you\' enjoy them.. Definitely  get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I\'m finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don\'t expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it\'s a no brainer and very easy to recommend.\n</span>']"

I did register each thumb twice, just to be thorough, but I'm very happy with the responsiveness. The reader is an in-display reader, centered and on the bottom (about where the old S7 button reader was). I did try a game. I tried a shooter. I played it full screen, and the in-display camera hole didnt bother me at all. It seems like important information is shifted over from the side of the screen just a hair to be compatible with the S10 selfie camera. Prior to buying the phone, I read that you can also opt to not play a particular game in full screen, and instead shave off that portion of the screen where the camera is. I didnt try this, but it should make the screen feel similar to an S8, which has that side of the screen shaved off for the slim bezel at the top of the phone, where the selfie camera is.<br><br>As a side note, if you're on the fence between an S10 or S20, the S20 does not have an audio port.

The phone was in perfect condition, not a scratch in sight. When I turned it on, it said ""Tmobile"". I was confused because I knew it was supposed to be an unlocked phone. I decided to still bring it in to see if I would be able to use it. It turned out that I was able to still use the phone, even though my carrier is Sprint. Everything seemed okay, at first. The next day was actually my birthday so everyone was saying happy birthday to me. I was getting texts and pictures and notifications, just not to my fitbit. I thought that was weird but I didn\'t really think much into it. When the day was over, I was frustrated because one of my best friends did not say ""Happy Birthday"" to me. When I texted him the next day, he sent me a screenshot of 5 messages he sent me. 1 was ""Happy Birthday"". I then posted on Facebook asking anyone else if they had sent me a message and I did not reply. 6 of my friends told me that they had said something. I then realized that I was not receiving all of my text messages. The next day, I went back to the sprint store to see if they could help me. I had already tried to restart my phone, delete messages. Nothing worked. They told me at the store that they did not see a problem with the phone.

All of a sudden, my music stops playing and starts playing something I have never listened to in my life. I pause the music. It started playing again. I looked at my recently listened to music. The majority of the music was something I had never listened to before. I looked at my playlists. 60 added playlists of the same music! I knew at that moment, I was hacked. I went into my emails and saw that multiple people have been signing into my account since I activated my phone. This phone helped someone, across the world, get all of my login information. I then had to change every single one of my passwords, especially my bank information. Tomorrow, I will be calling my bank to inform them of what has happened.<br><br>DO NOT TRUST THIS PHONE. It is cheap for a reason. I have never had anything like this ever happen to me before. I have always bought refurbished phones, and have never had a problem. Especially something like this. If it was not for my friends telling me that they did text me, I would have never known. These people could have broken into a lot more then just my spotify.

I used the mobile hotspot for approximately 6 hours yesterday running various tvs, computers, and other cell phones off of it. the fully charged battery lasted the entire day and had great reception on the electronics. I'm not a fan of any fingerprint locking as my phone's basically the house's community phone (it feels like!) so I have not tested that but the screen is very responsive. My last phone was an S5 and it lasted me 7 years, so being that this is my first upgrade I was surprised to see normal things like Message+, a calculator, calendar, and alarm clock not already loaded onto the phone but that was easily remedied and I found a widgit calendar I like better anyways, so, bonus. camera quality is obviously better than my s5, in low indoor lighting especially, which is nice for taking catch-the-moment photos with your littles. The only thing I always find incredibly annoying on any phone is that the advertised ___gigabytes on the phone are partially used up by basic running programs. I don't like opening up a 128gb phone to see that ____gb of storage are already used up..... why not just advertise 112gb of available storage space? anyways. that's all, super great phone, i recommend it, and very pleased with the 2 day shipping as well. Thanks!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  So, going against the majority of the negative reviews and trusting the few positive 4 star reviews I went ahead and got the s10 in black and I'm so glad I did. At practically half the price of a new store bought, with a few minor insignificant scratches that are either ways going to be covered with a case, this phone met all my expectations and more considering it was an emergency buy. My old phone got crushed by a car so yeah. Not much time to consider where to go next and then be broke for a good while. But I'm glad I trusted the few positive reviews and bought it Amazon renewed. As for the ones who had a bad experience I believe because of not being able to unlock the phone, I think the company knows about the issue and send an instruction step by step sheet about what to do if that happens. Either ways, I figured I could always return it if it went bad. But it was perfect, and I've had it for about a month now and no issues here. Love love love!!!!! Would definitely recommend buying from here.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was doubtful from the beginning, the phone came in a bag loose in a no-name box with nothing but the charger and USB cable. No manual or anything.<br><br>I tried putting the IMEI into MetroPCS\' website to transfer the phone to my account, and it said the IMEI was invalid. I tried swapping the SIM card anyway, and it said voice was disabled. Looking up that error lead me to the conclusion that the phone is not actually unlocked. I did some more digging and found out that it\'s still locked to Sprint, so I have to call them and try to get it unlocked.<br><br>If that doesn\'t work, I\'ll be returning it.<br><br>Do not buy one of these ""factory unlocked"" renewed phones.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I think it's really wrong that the battery can not be replaced by the user. So when the battery runs out in 18-24 months, you'll basically need to pay a bunch of money or get a new phone. Bring back the replaceable battery please.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The renewed samsung galaxy s10 prism black great it is basically brand new when I got it I thought it was brand new after a while it was still brand new but my only issue is the battery it slightly overheats or it just might be me using it a lot. I saw all the other reviews I thought the fingerprint reader said it was bad and if it is just add it again like 3 or 4 times. The camera is just so good. So overall it is brand new.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Although the Amazon page is for ""factory unlocked"" phones -- which should work on any carrier -- the phone I got could not be activated to my Sprint account. The device looked good and appeared to work otherwise. But alas, being a phone and all, it wasn\'t much use without a cell signal.<br><br>Just beware you may be rolling the dice here...\n</span>']"

I factory-reset the phone, as well as tested the phone with a SIM card that is known to be completely functional, which would not connect properly. I also tested the SIM card that was in it (and had previously worked fine in the phone) in a fully-functional phone and it worked correctly.

I spent 2 days going thru the settings and could not find anything to set up TALK-TO-TEXT or finger swipe on keyboard!  I use talk to text while driving, and this was a big downer. 3. In screen finger print was a pain. I like it on the back of phone better. 4. while I was out, I tried using internet with my data that I pay for in my plan..NOPE!! So the phone wouldn't work with wifi off!!! this was the final straw for me, as I use my phone at work, and there is no wifi! I use my phones data for internet and as a hotspot! This phone just didn't work for me. (also note: no 5G in this little farming town! I need 4G LTE) Connecting it to my carrier wasn't that difficult, but I did have to get with Tech Support to make it happen because it was an international phone. I sent it back yesterday and hope to be refunded within a week. I was disappointed because I researched this phone and really looked forward to having it. It described as being 4G LTE.. but that didn't happen for me. Again,, could be my area.\n</span>""]"

So be very careful with it, or get a designated screen protector for the camera as well.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The finger print reader takes 2-5 seconds to read and unlock the phone. Samsung has overloaded the phone with Samsung crappy apps that violate your privacy and steal your data without your permission. You can not disable or uninstall their apps. Even something as simple as emojis on a keyboard. If you are not usingbthe Samsung keyboard, you cannot use any emojis even though the icon is present. It tells you to switch to the Samsung keyboard to use emojis or stickers. They are using the keyboard to capture what you are typing. I block all Samsung apps with a firewall. Be aware of data stealing in any app. A manufacturer should never be doing this!\n</span>', '<span>\n  Samsung do better. You\'re charging $1,400 for a smartphone with a poorly functioning fingerprint sensor and camera autofocus. My Huawei Mate 9 blew this thing away years ago. The ""tricks"" posted by other users to improve biometrics do help the speed but they do not help with failed readings, that is a fault in the technology. Besides, we as users should not have to come up with novel ways to make your barely functional sensor slightly more functional. Also I just posted this same comment in the Samsung Reddit yesterday, but I can see they have done a good job policing their Reddit and promptly removing my comment...if only they put that same level of commitment into their development and QC for biometrics and camera functionality. The my 3 yr old Huawei was better on so many levels.

Specifically, the phone loses internet connection.  Do nothing, and sometimes connection is restored.  Trying common fixes, like changing browsers, wiping cache or resetting  network connection or temporarily changing carriers, etc., does not fix.  Factory reset does not fix.  A Samsung service center here in Silicon Valley thinks it is a motherboard issue but since the phone is new, there are no parts for several months (it is now mid-August 2020).<br><br>During the many attempts to restore internet service, I did (only once) see an error message flash during the boot cycle: ""SIM card not installed"".  So, I also removed, cleaned and reinserted the SIM card but that did not fix it.<br><br>The internet connection does work but then at some point, it will fail for a period of time.  Apparently this is not a new problem as other users have posted similar concerns on various other boards.  The phone is now OUT of return by 30 days, so I am now stuck in the warranty loop with Samsung.  Samsung will repair the phone but it will need to be shipped to Texas, meaning I am without my phone for 2 weeks (plus the pain of having to backup and restore data).<br><br>Recommendation: watch for this type of error and try to catch it before the exchange window expires.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Should have never downgraded to this phone.

Packaging was a repack ( not original box) but was re-wrapped, included new cable and charge block, phone was nearly charged to full. Included a nice screen protector. Setup was simple as new, no issues with transfer. My wife has been using for 3 days now and loves it (so far).

I started off with the Galaxy S3 moving to Galaxy S6, the Galaxy S8 Active ( my favorite so far) to the Galaxy Xcover Pro. I had to replace my S8 Active with a Xcover pro, because the S8 phone would not charge anymore in any way, and the Xcover pro was the closest match, even though it doesn\'t come close to the Galaxy S8 Active. Don\'t even know why Samsung has discontinued it.<br><br>I purchased my Galaxy pro around a month ago on Amazon, which provided a 30 day return policy, however around 3 weeks ago, I started experiencing problems with my phone screen, the phone started restarting on its own, and I started seeing some white lines on my screen. Did not give it too much attention as I was very busy at work, and did not have any time to attend this issue.<br><br>A couple days ago, the screen colors started fading, and the screen started acting up even more, tried calling samsung customer service yesterday but the hold times were over 2 hours, ended up giving up. This morning, I woke up to find the screen almost 90% faded, and the touch keys were not working, I was unable to use the phone at this point.<br><br>I decided to take the phone to the nearest samsung electronics service center in Maywood NJ. The manager over there was very friendly, accepted to service the phone even though I had no appointment. Once I showed her the model, she told me that she wasnt sure if this model was serviced at this location, but still showed it to the Tech which then confirmed that there are no spare part available for this phone. I was then given the option to ship the phone to samsung and get it fixed under warranty, which would leave me without a phone for 7 business days!!! and that was my only option since I have no other phone to use ( Galaxy S8 wont charge). I refused and was then advised to call 1-800-SAMSUNG<br><br>This is when it gets even better, the service rep who picked up the phone was making it look like I was making this story up, and was trying to convince me that there was never a screen issue with this phone, and that this is the first time he hears this, I then asked to speak with a supervisor, which told me the same thing and was then transferred to case management. After two hours on the phone and 1 hour driving to get in and back from the service center, case management advised me to call ""U break it we fix it"" which is the Authorised repair facility for Samsung as mentioned by case management. I call their location in Westwood, and guess what?? They do not have any spare parts and I was then referred to the Service Center in Maywood that handles uncommon phones like mine. SO guess what, 3 hours later back to square one, I took a day off to resolve this issue.<br><br>Bottom line is Samsung customer service is the worst!!! Will be duping this piece of trash in the garbage, and will purchase another phone with any other manufacturer that has an android platform.<br><br>Thank you SAMSUNG\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I really wanted to like this phone, removal battery, flat screen, a couple remappable buttons... Sounds perfect right? Well this phone was intended as my everyday carry phone, as well as my main work phone in a sales job out in the field. The biggest weakness of this phone is the processor... Completely inadequate for a demanding business environment. This is not a power user's phone. I did understand going into this that it was a mid-range phone, but it's inability to multitask was exacerbated by the fact that Android 10 is great at multitasking operations. I tried this phone for 28 days and had to return it. I loved the ruggedness, the removable battery which I was unable to find in the US sadly, the potential for Pogo charging which I was unable to find in the US sadly..<br><br>The phone I had before this was a note 8 which is definitely a flagship phone of its day, so someone coming from an older non flagship phone would probably be happy with this. It also made me sad that Samsung pay wasn't available at all.  Even for non MSG payment.<br><br>Ultimately I ended up getting an s10e which is such an excellent phone and has a flat screen which was one of my biggest wants after spending so much on curved screen protectors of any kind of quality.<br><br>Overall I would say pass it unless you expectations of multitasking and power using are set quite low.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Alright guys, I've gotta give it to this phone!! 5 stars for sure. And what initiated me to write my first amazon review? Running over this phone with my 10,000lb van. Yes that's right, through a series of events, I backed over my phone after I was done working under my van. I am happy to say this phone is working just as well as ever! What's nice is this phone has a lip that raises above the screen, so my glass screen protector was all that cracked. This does seem to be a very rugged phone! Most of all I love the camera on this phone. Uploaded are some great, un-edited pictures this phone captured. The wide angle lens really makes a difference sometimes! The battery is definitely an all day battery, and this phone works well with tmobile\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I bought Samsung Xcover Pro unlocked Verizon phone.  I tried to put it on Straight Talk, Total Wireless, Page Plus and other services, all that uses Verizon towers.  None of them would connect to the Samsung phone.  I am forced to either return the phone or to have service at Verizon.<br>Customer service at Samsung is HORRIBLE!!!  Spent hours and hours on the phone with them.  All they can come up with is it is not an issue with the phone, it is a service provider issue.  Even though I tried many different service providers.  I brought the phone into Geek Squad and they tried a couple different SIM cards, and they could not get the phone to connect to it.  Geek Squad wrote a statement saying there is something wrong with the phone.  Samsung still says it is not their issue.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I returned it. You would think buying an ""unlocked"" phone directly from Samsung would be fine. You would be wrong. AT&amp;T will soon no longer support calls made over non-LTE networks. This phone is technically able to do so using so-called ""voLTE."" HOWEVER, because it was not purchased from AT&amp;T, that ""feature"" is disabled. You can see the icon change to the older network when you initiate a call. Data works fine, though. AT&amp;T also disables wi-fi calling on this phone. NONE of this is disclosed to you when you purchase this phone.<br><br>Also, if you are buying this as a potential replacement for the S8 Active, you will be very disappointed. The screen is washed out looking in comparison. The audio is terrible from the speaker for speakerphone calls. It lacks wireless charging. The processor is sluggish. The overall feel of the phone is just cheap. It\'s a shame Samsung didn\'t continue the Active line. Look elsewhere.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I love the phone. It is so much nicer than my older Note 4.  It has Facial Recognition, as well as a Fingerprint Reader. This Fingerprint reader is now part of the on/off button on the side of the phone. You only need to position your index finger on it as you hold the phone in your hand... no more swiping your finger!  In addition to the up and down volume toggle buttons on the right edge of the phone, there is a power button which is also the finger print reader. There are two additional buttons, one of the left edge and one on the top edge, both of which can be assigned to an app or a event.  The LED light used for notification has been moved from the top front of the phone to the top edge of the phone, so you can't always see the LED flashing unless you're looking at the top edge of the phone.<br><br>The phone is thin and actually longer than my Note 4. In addition, the screen is larger and resolution is higher especially since the the display is the entire front, as there is no loner a bezel. Even the front facing camera is inside the screen display, which is strange when looking at a picture since you may think that there is a black dot in the top right of the picture, when actually it is the front facing camera.<br><br>Since the phone is not sold by Verizon, I had some issues getting it provisioned.  Some of the Verizon employees said it wasn't supported, when in fact it is. The phone has two SIM card slots. When I entered the 1st IMEI number (slot 1) on the Verizon site, it said that this phone is a perfect match. I eventually got it provisioned by swapping the SIM card between my Note 4 and XCover Pro phones.  The only remaining issue is that voice mail doesn't work when the SIM in in the XCover Pro.  I have to believe that that will eventually get fixed. (I am on hold with Verizon as I type this).<br><br>The documentation is almost useless. A simple pamphlet is provided with a basic diagram, but it is not clearly evident that slot 1 actually has a lower slot for a Verizon nano SIM card, and an upper slot, for the SD card.  There is of course a second SIM card slot to the right of first for a GSM SIM card. You need to remove the large battery to access any of the slots (which is simple).  Also the first SIM card slot has a very tiny embedded lever that allows you to easily remove the nano SIM card! I didn't look to see if the second SIM card slot has a similar lever.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I'm going to have to give this phone a solid pass. I've purchased several other phones this week. All were rugged phones and all were simple to find the wifi calling. I've spent nearly a couple hours trying to figure it out by watching  YouTube videos and reading. No phone that you spend this kind if money on should be this difficult  to find simple functions that when using other phones, you simply  just got to wifi settings and advanced settings  to be put in the right place. I don't have the patience to fool around with this nonsense anymore and as such it's going back. Please fix the user interface!!!!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  It took two phones ( the first shipped with no battery, shame on Samsung ) but once I had it and got it working, it\'s fine. Nice large and clear screen, quick fingerprint scanner and face recognition, battery lasts reasonably well. I really don\'t need a ""superthin"" expensive super phone and this works well and has features I like, like ruggedized, removable battery and dual sim ( once Samsung gets the software done to activate that ). This is NOT 5G capable but those networks are still coming in, will take awhile, and the 4G LTE works fine anyway.<br><br>Good luck finding a spare battery. Nothing on Amazon or that other large Internet vendor. Good luck finding a dedicated charger for the battery outside of the phone. There are some ""universal"" chargers on Amazon and elsewhere but I returned the one I ordered, wouldn\'t work even following maker\'s specific instructions for XCover Pro battery. Cheaply made junk IMHO.<br><br>So where is Samsung? Hey, I want to spend more money with you! Gone missing. This phone has been selling retail since early this year. But, nothing on their web site(s) for extra battery or dedicated charger. I called their service line, 1-800-SAMSUNG this morning ( Saturday ). That rep referred me to ""sales"". That was a crummy phone connection to an ESL person obviously overseas. After she did much looking and off line research, that rep said I need to talk to ""parts"" which isn\'t open weekends ( ! ). She said she will send me an e-mail number with the ""parts"" contact information for next week. I hope so but so far since the call, no e-mail yet.<br><br>It\'s no bueno that I can\'t use one of the best features of this phone, swapable battery. Even more so that Samsung has such weak support for their otherwise nice product.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  The number one reason I purchased this phone was to get something a little more current than my old LG G5, but that had a replaceable battery.  That battery is a MUST HAVE for my work, and it just so happens to be one of the main selling points on Samsung's product page.  After buying the phone in August, I was told that batteries were just a little delayed in being available due to COVID.  I've checked back periodically and it's just not available in North America that I can tell.  (Review date is 11/30, so I've been patient.)  I've tried via Samsung and via 3rd party sites.  When calling (or chatting) with Samsung numerous times, all they ever do is refer you to other departments in a big circle.  They absolutely refuse to support their own product.  I never had service issues with LG.  (I mean, problems would crop up occasionally, but they handled them.  Not Samsung - they have simply TERRIBLE support.)  Had I known this would be so much trouble, I would not have purchased the phone.  Samsung advertising a replaceable battery = false advertising.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I love my LG G5 so much I bought more than 15 of it for my family and relatives, and 1 as a back up for myself, but unfortunately both died... one wouldn\'t turn on again one day and the other takes too much effort to repair. I have been eyeing this phone from Samsung since May 2020, but the only reason why I did not get it sooner was because the spare battery was nowhere to be found in the states. WTH Samsung? I was ready to upgrade the whole family to this phone, but you\'ve let us down - you\'ve let a lot of folks down.<br>So why then the 5 stars? Read on....<br><br>Going from the LG G5 to this phone was smooth. Only a few things that bothered me. So lets go over the cons first:<br>- No spare battery available in th US. Enough said.<br>- Volume is lower than any other phone I\'ve used. I\'ve disabled the volume limiter, but the volume on max settings for this phone including for its loudspeaker is still too low. For a phone marketed for industrial use, the audio quality should atleast be up to par with other phones. Microphone is clear and crisp, but what good is it if you can\'t really hear the other person on the line while being in an industrial environment? Regular users should be okay with the volume.<br>- The fingerprint reader/power button is on the right near the volume buttons and is flushed with the side making hard to feel for  whereas the G5 has it slightly raised and it is the only button on the back...so it was easier to feel for. Would really rather have the ""XCover"" button as the power/fingerprint button.<br>- Default button and screen page layout for this phone is messy and frustrating to navigate. It will require some fiddling to get a better end result. Can be much easier to use than the G5. My suggestion...download a button remapper app. It will make your life much easier. Let\'s just hope Samsung doesn\'t decide to disable the 3rd party button remapper as their button remapper is extremely limited, junk.<br>- No IR blaster. Who uses it these days? I do, and quite often. Really miss this option...but then again...it\'s just me.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Long battery life. I use my phone heavily... to give you an idea...I go through at least 3 to 4 G5 batteries a day. With this phone from morning until night ...I still have about 20% left to go. This is the reason why I am not knocking off a star for the spare battery issue - there\'s  really no need to change battery. However, like all batteries, their charge cycles diminishes, and also because there will be time when I am out for days without a charger. Therefore, I still would like to see Samsung live up to its promises.<br>- Feels good on the hand. Feels solid... not slipper...no fingerprints all over the phone. Looks clean - all the time.<br>- Top button by default is a flashlight on/off. You can change the settings to even have it accessible even when the phone is locked. This is definitely one of my favorite feature for this phone. Ofcourse you can also remap it to other things too if you so choose. Same with the left ""Xcover"" button.<br>- Removable battery and is waterproof? As long as you dont drop it deep into a lake...I was already sold on the removable battery.<br>- Better cameras. The cameras setup is similar to what you get with the G5: Main camera, wide camera, and selfie...just better quality.<br>- Charges quickly. For a battery this size...it completes its charge almost at the same time as the LG G5.<br><br>Other things to consider:<br>- May be on the heavier side. I don\'t mind this at all, but it is heavier than the G5. Just something you might want to note.<br><br>Conclusion: it is an upgrade from the LG G5. And for the price, it definitely deserves a 4.5 five star rating. However, I can\'t give half a star, so I\'ll give it a 5 star and hope that Samsung will finally make available the spare battery plus charging cradle.\n</span>']"

This is an amazing phone for the price and it's super quick even though it is 2 years old. This review however will cover the handset itself since it is a refurbished unit. The internals are fine and work properly and everything else reports as it should. So what does reburshied get you physically? Let's find out...<br><br>Let's go over the outside of the phone. There are a few micro scratches on the front and back of the phone. Being that its covered in glass doesn't shock me. However this particular unit came with some pretty deep scratches on the top right corner of the front glass. It's extremely noticeable, and to be honest I felt as if I was robbed a little. 350 dollars is a lot to spend on phone. For a refurbished unit you would think that a blemish as bad as that would have been fixed. Either it needed to be buffed or replaced. The buttons are super clicky as they should be. The touch screen is still extremely responsive, and the battery life is relatively good. I do use this phone on its max resolution and max brightness. I can watch Netflix for a straight 6 hours before it yells at me to charge it.<br><br>Overall it's not too bad. Those scratches are disappointing, but I guess that is the price of buying refurbished.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I lost my other phone never to be found again so far.

And I found this phone, which I had been doing the research on them before losing my other phone and I could only dream that I could buy one because of the price was out of this world untouchable for my income. This is refurbished unlocked and the best price that I had ever found. It works like the dream that I knew it would once I got it in my hands. It has so many features it never gets old trying to figure out how t use it. It looks brand new no scratches it was an is perfect. I love it. and will get many years I hope out of it.

Important is transferring the phone service from old one  to this phone is just about 15minutes long fast and easy contact the provider and will help you the rest..\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Honestly first of all I have to say I am so happy that I got a flagship phone at a cheap price like this. I was super worried that it wouldn't work with Cricket because that's the company that I'm with. When I first got the phone I put my Cricket SIM card in and it didn't register for a moment.  I would also like to mention that I received an AT&amp;T phone however it can runs on Cricket! It's a Wonderful phone however I will say it seems that the battery does run out a bit fast for my liking, it normally slows around 80% and then after 80% it's pretty good. But that shouldn't be really anything to worry about because you could simply just get a battery replacement. But other than that it's an excellent phone and I'm really happy that I received it!

The reason for the low score is they convinced me this phone would still have 80% of it\'s full charge, and that was why I chose it over something else.

Build quality is solid, the screen is bright and color accurate (though it has an ugly blemish - a hole punch camera in the top left corner), and it matches or beats out most other flagships on the market when it comes to specs (5G, Snapdragon 865, 12GB RAM, 256GB UFS 3.1 storage, 65W fast charging, stereo speakers, 4500mah battery). Camera quality is good, not better than that found on Google\'s Pixel series of phones but it\'s competitive with other brands like Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Xiaomi, etc. I\'m using the phone on Mint Mobile which uses T-Mobile\'s networks, I have had no issues with coverage and receive strong 5G signal in my area as well. The phone is not too big too handle nor too small to media consumption on. There\'s no wireless charging but I don\'t care about that in the slightest, especially when the phone charges so fast.<br><br>The fingerprint reader is amazing. OnePlus seriously has the best in-screen fingerprint readers in the industry. It\'s accurate, fast, and so easy to use. I do not know of a phone with a better fingerprint reader. The phone is capable of facial recognition but I do not trust facial recognition as no matter how good the technology; it can be used to quickly unlock your phone without consent. To each their own.<br><br>Another fantastic thing about this phone is that OnePlus still allows customers to unlock the bootloader of the device. Many other US smartphone manufacturers no longer allow you to do this. Why does this matter? When the phone reaches end-of-life and no longer receives support from the manufacturer you can flash an alternate ROM like LineageOS. It also allows you to root your device if you\'re into that sort of thing. I personally think it should be criminal to sell a device with a locked bootloader. Can you imagine if you bought a laptop running Windows 8 but were artificially prohibited from upgrading to Windows 10? Many smartphone brands do the equivalent of this and I refuse to purchase their products because of it. Thank you OnePlus for respecting consumer choice and fighting e-waste.<br><br>The phone\'s software is smooth and fairly close to a ""stock"" Android experience. Some tweaks are definitely made under the hood but OxygenOS is far from obtrusive and is highly customizable. Of course, having an unlockable bootloader means you have the freedom to load something else if you want. One thing I love is that unlike some other brands, OnePlus mostly relies on Google\'s own software suite of apps and doesn\'t attempt to force duplicate manufacturer-branded versions of things like e-mail software on the user. There are exceptions to this, special features such as ""Zen mode"" and OnePlus does have their own Gallery as well as a File Manager. I see the File Manager as a bit of an odd addition alongside the default Files app. My mentality is that device manufacturers shouldn\'t spend too much time on developing device-specific software. If a user has a problem with the default Files app they can find an alternative in the Play Store. I don\'t see it as necessary for OnePlus to include out of the box solutions to problems that may or may not exist for users. It\'s certainly not a bad app but it seems redundant. Keep it simple. Let people install what they want after they have the device in their hands. This is a minor grievance however. OxygenOS as a whole is smooth, responsive, and receives frequent updates. It\'s one of the few manufacturer Android skins I don\'t hate.<br><br>This is where my review will turn a bit more critical. First things first, the hole punch camera. It\'s hideous. I have long been putting off buying a new phone because I hate how almost every flagship on the market has a notch or hole punch in its screen. Why? I never had a problem with bezels on my smartphone, and while having a high screen-to-body ratio is nice, it\'s not nice when it comes at the cost of putting a giant black dot in the corner of my screen. I watch a lot of videos and consume a lot of content on my device. Every time I look at this phone I see this ugly blemish on my screen, like a blob of dead pixels. I hate it. The only thing I can praise OnePlus for is that at least they put it in the left corner and not the center like some other manufacturers. It\'s still awful. You see it when the screen is off, when it\'s on, and it\'s especially noticeable when watching videos shot in aspect ratios wide enough to fill the screen (contrary to popular belief, many movies and online videos are not in 16:9). I know that OnePlus is not the only manufacturer to utilize a hole punch yet just because everyone else is doing it doesn\'t make it okay.<br><br>Next, it lacks a 3.5mm audio jack, colloquially referred to as a ""headphone jack"". Again, OnePlus is not the only manufacturer to do this with their devices, that doesn\'t make it okay. I love listening to music. Thing is, Bluetooth quality sucks. I have a decent sound system in my car and I can clearly make out the difference between a wired connection and a Bluetooth one. I\'m switching from a Google Pixel XL which had a 3.5mm audio jack and I almost feel like I\'m downgrading. No 3.5mm to USB-C adapter is included in the box and OnePlus doesn\'t actually sell an official one listed as compatible with the OnePlus 8T. OnePlus is basically telling all their customers with hi-fi audio equipment that they don\'t care if said customers can enjoy their music. ""Never Settle"" seems like a silly slogan for OnePlus to have nowadays. There\'s plenty of space inside the phone and there is no official IP certification so I refuse to accept those as reasons to lack the jack.<br><br>Next, there\'s the bloatware. There isn\'t a lot, though Netflix sticks out like a sore thumb. I use Netflix, there\'s nothing wrong with the app. The problem is that it comes preinstalled and can\'t be uninstalled. You can disable it if you like but it will still take up storage on your device. I don\'t think this is acceptable. If somebody has the desire to uninstall a preinstalled application they should be able to do so unless doing so would directly inhibit the functionality of the device. This is simply a consumer rights issue for me and I\'m pretty passionate about it.<br><br>On a final note, the aesthetic of the phone is good. It looks like a flagship smartphone should and is built well. The hole punch camera makes the screen ugly, other than that I like how it looks. The Lunar Silver color is a bit less glossy than I was hoping for, and it almost looks blue under light. Personally I think the glossier silver finish of the OnePlus 7 Pro looked better. The screen is bright and color accurate though not as bright as I\'ve seen on a few other flagships<br><br>Overall, I like this phone but dislike the compromises (hole punch camera, lack of 3.5mm audio jack, bloatware) that come with buying it. There\'s a lot to like, not enough to love. I was in desperate need of a phone and this was the only thing on the market that appealed to me at all. I really hate that I had to settle for a hole punch camera and no 3.5mm audio jack.<br><br>Update: Decided to return this phone after it was causing me a lot of stress. I\'m not okay with where Bluetooth technology is in 2020 and I\'m disgusted by manufacturers removing the 3.5mm audio jack from devices and trying to force customers to use an inferior technology. Bluetooth sound quality is awful and it constantly fails to pair. I couldn\'t consistently get this phone to connect to my car\'s stereo unit from one day to the next.<br><br>You might say just use a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, I tried that. Sound quality was slightly better but barely. Overall I found myself having to keep my stereo lower than I\'m used to simply because the signal that this phone outputs is not good.<br><br>In addition to this, I also see OxygenOS as becoming bloated and filled with things that are not relevant to the Android experience. Why is ""Shot on OnePlus"" on my phone? Why is Netflix preloaded and why can\'t it be uninstalled? Why is Zen mode a thing? I\'m tired of manufacturers trying to put their own spin on Android. Keep it simple, please. Just copy what Google does with the Pixel series, please.<br><br>Camera quality was also another concern for me. Sometimes the OnePlus 8T takes amazing photos, other times they come out blurry, over-saturated, or there\'s so much shutter lag between hitting the capture button and the photo actually taking that you miss your shot. It\'s infuriating. Coming from a Google Pixel which captured amazing shots almost every time, feels like a bit of a downgrade. I also hate that it the 8T doesn\'t have a telephoto lens.<br><br>The cost of charging accessories is another huge thing for me. Warp Charge accessories are extremely expensive, it\'s over $50 just for a Warp Charge 30 car charger. I can\'t justify spending that much money just to charge my phone even if the actual experience of using Warp Charge is awesome. The 8T doesn\'t have wireless charging which I personally don\'t care about much, but why does OnePlus use the slogan ""Never Settle"" when they clearly are expecting the customer to settle?<br><br>In addition to this, OnePlus has been releasing so many devices lately that customers have been complaining about slow updates and poor support for older phones. Also, I\'ve just never gotten used to the ugly hole punch camera. I just don\'t see OnePlus as the brand it thinks it is. ""Never Settle"" is a funny slogan for a company that tries to make their customers settle for so much. Glad to be returning this mediocre phone.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  There's a bit of controversy with this phone mostly due to the fact that you can get a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for $50 less, at the time of this review. They have mostly the same specs except the OnePlus 8T does not have wireless charging and an official IP rating. Both of which the Samsung 20 FE does have. The North American model of the Oneplus 8T is only sold with 12GB RAM + 256GB, which makes the device $50 more expensive in comparison to the EU models.<br><br>I came from a Samsung Galaxy s9 and this phone feels like a huge upgrade. The 120hz display is so smooth and addictive! The snapdragon 865 paired with 12GB of ram literally destroys anything you throw at it, in the best way possible of course. There is no OFFICIAL IP rating on the device BUT, upon watching many teardown videos and water tests with the 8T, the phone is in fact built to resist water but just doesn't have the official rating. Personally, I have no need for wireless charging capability but in return of losing wireless charging, you get 65 watt fast charging. The 65W fast charging is something to behold. The phone charges from 0-100% in literally 40 minutes, 58% in 15 minutes. Not to mention, it has a 4500mAh battery which is absolutely massive and can for last a full day of regular use WITH 120hz active.<br><br>I purchased this phone over the Galaxy S20 FE mainly because of the near stock android experience, and the flagship specs for less money than its older brothers. I could have gotten a pixel, but the specs of this phone paired with android 11 stock android is an absolute dream. I can safely say I do not miss One UI one bit. Goodbye bixby.<br><br>The cameras get the job done. Not as good as the pixel 5, but they take solid pictures in good lighting and the night mode is just okay.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Can\'t find a phone like this with this price and specifications compared to other brands it seems. Was worried about compatibility but works great with Verizon, just had to put my sim card in and call customer service for ""cdma-less activation."" It\'s only been a few days since I\'ve gotten this phone but so far I don\'t have any issues.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Great phone, meets all my standards for a phone and I like the build quality.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Just got this phone from amazon warehouse deals for ~550 and I think I like it a lot.  Condition was ""used very good"" - and upon arrival I couldn\'t find a scratch or anything - looked like someone just took it out of the package and put it back in, but otherwise brand new.<br><br>I think phone is awesome. I particularly like oneplus because it\'s one of the few manufacturers that provide ability to unlock bootloader and install lineage OS. This is about the best phone you can get if you intend to install Lineage at some point as I do. I was  debating between this and Samsung galaxy S20 FE - and unlockable bootloader just did it for me. Also clean experience - no useless bundled facebook spyware apps and such.<br><br>its as fast as advertised, has all the cricket LTE bands, UFS 3.1 fast storage, fairly clean of bloatware, nice bright display, fast charging yadda yadda yadda. And as others have mentioned - despite the lack of official IP rating - many youtubers have confirmed it is in fact waterproof (YSK - however - even if phone has official IP rating - manufacturers dont cover water damage  by warranty anyways, so would not rush to go swimming with it regarless of IP rating).<br><br>Things I dont like (but not gonna remove stars  - as  unfortunately all US-sold  smartphones are doing the same):<br>- glass back. I just hate glass backs. I\'ll take metal or plastic any day of the week. Even with a case -  I do tend to drop my phones a lot and glass s the type of material that just tends to, you know - break.<br>- no 3.5 mm jack.  shame. I much prefer simplicity of wired headphones.<br>- no user-replaceable battery (I know that ship has sailed long ago - but im still gonna mention it)<br><br>Edit: some people say they received wrong model, but I can confirm - US model KB2005.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Oneplus 8T is the best phone I have ever used.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Really good product!\n</span>', '<span>\n  5G is only available in T mobile network. very poor fingerprint sensor.

Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.<br>I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them.  Put in settings so power options do come up now.

Signal is great on tmobile.  5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off.  but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.<br>Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors!  Updates get sent all the time.  So worth it!<br><br>And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens.  For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance.  S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9.  The rest is pretty similar.<br>---<br>It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.<br><br>I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.<br><br>I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.<br><br>I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.<br><br>I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!<br><br>I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.<br><br>Please note, red it definitely an orangey red.  I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.<br><br>I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.<br><br>Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full.  The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow.

I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.<br>Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.<br><br>Happy happy!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I had my previous phone, a Huawei Mate 9  for 3 years (ordered from Amazon), and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G, I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me, it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far, everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange, but I had to go with my favorite color, Cloud Mint.<br><br>The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone, the bright light is a little blinding, especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.<br><br>For the battery life, it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G, I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos, using social media, surfing the internet, etc.), I would have to charge it after a day, but with the Mate 9, I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.<br><br>I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen, which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!<br><br>Included in the box: phone, charging adapter, charging cable, paperwork, and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones, but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds, but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.<br><br>When I received my package and I opened it up, it came with ZERO packaging, which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box. Amazon, please make sure the package is secured well so the product we are paying $$$ for arrives safely.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.<br><br>Auto focus:<br>The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes &gt;5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.<br>A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is &gt;20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.<br>This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.<br>The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focus<br><br>Finger Print Sensor:<br>It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.<br>Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.<br>Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.<br><br>Using the Camera kills other apps:<br>I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.<br><br>Note: Moved to this phone from the S9\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I really love this phone! I just switched from an iPhone 6s to this by switching out my sim card no problem. You should know that it doesn't come with a cable that will connect an iPhone with this phone, so purchase that beforehand if you want to switch over all of your settings, apps, etc... but you can get them transferred over via icloud.<br><br>The camera is miles better than my old one, but the selfie, front facing camera is awful. It makes you look like marzipan, like its perpetually stuck on beauty mode. Its frustrating, but I'm not a selfie queen anyway, so I'm not too upset about it. But upset enough to give it 4 stars.<br><br>This was the first phone I ordered from Amazon and I'm pretty pleased!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I honestly haven't had any problems with this phone and I've had it for over a month now. Honestly I think it's a perfect mid-range phone since I wasn't willing to pay flagship prices for the higher end s20's. This phone is fast and the 120hz makes scrolling flawless. The camera, while not the best on the market, still takes amazing pictures unless you zoom in too much. The battery life lasts way longer than my old phone, I usually don't have to charge until I go to bed. Of course if you're using it all day then the battery will drain quicker, otherwise yes it does last all day. Also I have MetroPCS and had no problems switching to this phone or connecting to the 5G network. Overall, if you looking for a decent but cheaper upgrade then this is the prefect phone!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  This unlocked phone has so many bugs! The touch screen is unresponsive 30% of the time. The phone will freeze for no apparent reason. The internet gets dropped no matter if you're on 5G, LTE, 4G, 3G or 2G.<br><br>Besides all that, if you want a sleek and slim phone case with a kickstand, we'll tie gonna have to wait because they don't exist. Only the big, bulky brick in your pocket case with kickstands exists at the moment.<br><br>Bottom line... This phone was put out on the market before everything was ready.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Love this phone, very pleased with finger print reader... However you can only record 3 different fingers. Very good phone - excellent camera, especially front facing!<br>My only complaint, why it was 4 stars instead of 5 was we bought the orange color phone for my husband and when it came it was more of a light peach/pinky color. A nice color, but obviously more girly than anticipated. It's an easy fix to cover up, but we were disappointed because the color online looks more orange than it actually is.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Phone worked well for a couple hours.  Then started getting message that wireless charging paused.  Would wait for charger, Samsung model, to stop blinking red.  Would try again.  Maybe one time in four it would work.  Took the case off and had the exact same behavior.  Tried my old phone and it worked 100% of tries, so returned S20 FE 5G.\n</span>']"

I\'ve been an LG smartphone user since my first smartphone. LG has  been a bit of a letdown as of late. I still love the brand but decided to make the jump to Samsung. I may be a convert. I cannot think of one bad thing to say of the A51. As far as budget phones go you could do much worse. The camera is awesome. Scratch that. Cameras. So many photo options. The food lense makes me feel like a pretentious food blogger. Or is that influencer? The battery is all day strong. The phone may be a little laggy (hardly ever for my needs) but I\'m not trying to send people to Mars with my device. Suck it Elon. I found it for less than $300 and I am smitten with my purchase. If you are looking for a ""budget"" device stop now. Samsung S models are great but you don\'t really need to spend that much money on a phone. And god forbid you drink Apple\'s Kool-Aid.

The other phone that was good started with charge problems after one month, it charge time to time and it is not the charger because we had two charger and one of the phones is charging well, so there is an issue with the phone, I contacted Amazon around 33 days after the purchase and they told me that after 30 days I have to contact to the seller directly, I did and they do no acept return or replace, they offered 15 dolars. I wrote this review for you to know that you can spend almost 300 dolars with them and still need a phone, so I think that this can help you to reconcidere to buy a phone to this company, it is a surprise box, the phone can charge well for 30 days and then can not charge. I saw the company review before the purchase and I thought that O can trust in this company but I was wrong.<br><br>Yo compre dos telefonos el mismo dia, uno vino con el sello abierto y lo retorne y la compañia me envio el ramplazo y este trabaja bien.

Yo contacte a amazon sobre los 33 dias y ellos me dijeron que despues de 30 dias tenia q contactar a la compañia que me vendio el telefono directamente, yo lo hice y ellos no aceptan retorno o remplazo, ellos me ofrecieron 15 dolares. Yo escribo este review para que tu sepas que puedes gastar 300 dolares con ellos  y todavia necesitar un telefono, yo creo que esto puede ayudarte a reconciderar comprarte un telefono con ellos, esoe s una caja de sorpresa, el telefono puede cargar bien por 30 dias y luego puede no cargar. Yo mire los review del vendedor antes de comprarlos y pense que podia confiar pero estuve equivocada.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone itself works fine. The issue I had after purchase was actually finding a carrier that the phone will work under. It could be dependent on my area but very few of the MVNOs accepted the IMEI number. The few that did, do not offer service in my area. I ended up having to settle on straight talk wireless and the only SIM card that would work was the AT&amp;T one....which of course has poor coverage in my city. So just beware unless you live in a major metro area, you will have issues. Even Mint wouldn’t accept the IMEI of the phone and others didn’t seem to have issues with Mint for this unlocked phone.

Why can't you just replace the phone with another one.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Phone is exactly as described, brand new in box and works perfectly on Straight Talk. I was unsure if this phone would work with straight talk, the main reason being that it's a GSM phone and all of my previous phones have been CDMA.

After that, I just had to put the new sim card in my new phone and abracadabra!

When you close that and open mail again the draft is gone, start over. Voice to text struggles to even stay on while talking. The mic will turn on and then off again before I can get a word out.

My previous phone had cracked so badly that it would cost more than it was worth to fix so I found this one and it looked like it was too good of a deal to be true. At the time I bought this the same phone was selling for between 800 and 700 dollars on the actual Samsung website. I've never purchased a phone through Amazon before and I was so worried that it was some sort of scam or I'd be sent a brick phone. That couldn't be further from the truth. The phone came in a cardboard box, not original Samsung packaging, which was something I expected. It came with a knockoff Samsung charger which was okay but the phone itself was perfect, no scratches or any marks, it powered up without any carrier logos. My boyfriend actually ordered this same one because he loved how good of a deal it was and it was time for an upgrade. This is the best purchase I've made on Amazon, the phone has been perfect there's no indication it wasn't bought directly from Samsung themselves. If you're considering ordering this phone I say do it! I'm so grateful that I did.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  This product has bad telecom connections works only on open space, but doesn't work in building\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was weary of buying a refurbished phone online,  especially after reading the reviews of people getting stolen phones,  but after recieving mine i was pleasantly surprised.  The phone is in great shape with only a minor, barely visible scratch on the back,  the only other thing included was an Energizer fast charger(not the original but it works just as well), but that\'s to be expected. I\'m not entirely sure if the phone is actually unlocked though, as there is a sprint ""activate device"" notification that pops up when i restart the phone but i have straight talk and it works with locked phones because they use other companies towers(so if you have straight talk you have nothing to fear other than getting badly damaged device, but that\'s covered under the 90 day warranty.  The phone is fast,  fingerprint sensor works perfectly and the battery has only been discharged 18 cycles. This is definitely a good deal when compared to the $900 price tag of a new device. If i have any problems with the phone i will update this review,  but for now, it\'s a thumbs up from me\n</span>', '<span>\n  Phone arrived in like new condition, but the APNs cannot be changed, so you can only use it on Verizon proper, none of their MVNOs will work.<br>""Add APN"" is grayed out, and unable to add new APN for any of the Verizon MVNOs, so this is the first Verizon phone that I\'ve heard of that is actually locked to their Network.<br>Had to switch to Verizon from Straight Talk Verizon to be able to use the phone.\n</span>', '<span class=""cr-original-review-content"">\n  Simple mente me encanto estoy súper contento Con la compra\n</span>', '<span class=""cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden""></span>', '<span>\n  I was really excited to get this phone. I have no major complaints about how the phone itself runs. However, the main reason i returned it was because I was unable to put a privacy or any other screen protector on it. The finger print reader doesn’t work when you have a screen protector on it. So I had to rely on facial recognition. This was annoying because I wear contact during the day and glasses at night, so whenever I wear my glasses I have to take them off for my phone to recognize my face and unlock the screen. The phone also comes with a pre-Installed screen protector, but it’s absolutely horrible. Since I wasn’t able to use a regular screen protector I just used the one that was already on it. Unfortunately it’s prone to scratches. The thin film is basically a sticker and gets easily scratched. So my protector got completely scratched up after not having the privacy screen on it for a couple of hours. So my only complain is based on aesthetics, and not the software or phone itself.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Phone arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  There was no sign that it had ever been used before, even though it is refurbished.  Works well.  I wanted the factory unlocked version, and that is what I got.  Overall, happy with the vendor.  As for the Galaxy S10, I upgraded from a S6, so yes, this is way better.  Battery life is great, display is excellent, and the pictures are the best I've seen from a cell phone.  My only minor gripe is that the new type of fingerprint reader is more picky than the old type on my S6.  I often have to try 2-3 times before it recognizes my print.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This is my first Amazon phone purchase. I was so hesitant, but because of Amazon\'s awesome return policy, I figured I would do it! And I am so glad I did! I bought an Amazon Renewed S10 and got a great deal for it. The phone itself has great reviews. The phone came with a generic charger and charging wire. I didn\'t mind. I just bought a new fast charger. No ear phones, but again I didn\'t mind. The phone itself was beautiful and was unlocked as advertised. No visible scratches or defaults. It looked like a brand new phone. I have AT&amp;T and it was a super easy set up. I just used my SmartSwitch app and transferred everything from my old phone and switched the micro card to activate. I set up the Fingerprint, but was disappointed that it was not working consistently. After getting frustrated, I just switched to face recognition. Then, I realized the phone came with a screen protector already on it. Though, it had a ""cutout"" for your thumbprint, I realized this was the problem. Also, it was not placed on correctly and was off center. I removed it and now my fingerprint works perfectly every time. Still debating on replacing the screen protector because the screen is pretty tough on its own. The battery lasts forever and the speed is crazy fast. Overall, love the phone. The phone itself also shipped within a few days. To think I almost paid $1k for a new phone! Never again!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  It arrived on time and I was really anxious that something would be wrong and that I'd have to return it, BUT I opened the box and thought it's a perfectly new phone! No visible signs of use and it is factory unlocked. Great Camera, Fingerprint reader, screen, speed and it works with Verizon without any problems. Recieved it today and I'm writing the review with it right now! Totally happy!  Oh and I was really surprised that this phone has an amazing Dolby atmos sound!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Unfortunately these are international phones and can't be used in the USA. Bought 2 and both are headed back to get me my refund. Wish it would specify that. Seen a few ppl say it works great 5 stars so I'm assuming they just grab one not knowing and ship it to you. Never even knew there were American phones and international phones.. dumbest thing ive ever gone thru. Hope this helps! The phones were in great condition tho I'll give em that.\n</span>""]"

They shipped the wrong phone initially, but once I got the right one, it has been stellar. I also checked the s/n, and the phone was almost a year newer than the previous seller. It is even still listed as under warranty by Samsung.\n</span>', '<span>\n  My phone arrived packaged well and on time. Unlike some other reviewers, my unit was truly unlocked and activated smoothly with Sprint. Everything on the phone is in good working condition, with no functional issues with the camera, ports, sensors, or screen.<br> The reason I\'m giving it only three stars is because the phone shows some minor flaws due to being used. The screen and back have multiple small scratches, and the speaker grill was very dirty. The battery life is good, but definitely below that of a brand new unit.  The phone is listed as refurbished, and priced accordingly, but it comes off as more of a ""used in good condition"" product than a ""factory refurbished"" one.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I've used just about every smartphone OS and was a long-time Blackberry user until moving to Apple around 2012.  I was able to play with every smartphone OS (for work) and since Android was hit or miss back then I settled for iOS.<br><br>I decided to give Android another try with the Galaxy S9.  Yes, I was also very skeptical about trying a refurbished phone but given Amazon's gracious return policy I felt it was worth the risk.<br><br>My received unit came in a plain white (smartphone) box and came with original Samsung accessories -- new charger, USB to USB-C cable, wired headphones and a USB to USB-C adapter.<br><br>The phone itself was covered in plastic.  Upon removing the plastic the phone looked to be brand new.  Zero scratches or dings on the screen.  Perhaps a few super-fine scratches on the back but hardly noticeable.<br><br>The phone came about 80% charged and powered up with no issues.  Disappointingly, the phone came with the stock Android 8.0 firmware.  While connected to Wi-Fi I didn't receive any update notifications -- which was annoying.  I put in my nano-SIM and again still no notifications to update.  A manual update didn't work either.  I started looking to flash the appropriate Android 9 image to the phone directly but after about 20 minutes I finally received a notice to update.  Sadly, this was a linear process.  In total, I probably did about 8 updates.  A few 8.0 patches and then the large 9.0 update and then a few more 9.0 patches.  It seems with Android OS you cannot just upgrade to the latest Android version.  Lame.<br><br>That being said, the phone has been working great with no issues.  There are some quirks about Android 9 I don't like but then again there are a lot of features to like.<br><br>Positives:<br>S9 is still very fast device for 2019<br>Gorgeous, high-resolution screen (570ppi)<br>Faster charging (compared to my iPhone XS Max)<br>Very lightweight and a slim profile<br>MicroSD slot<br>Accessories cost less.  Spigen case for $13!<br>Can have 35 icons on a single page -- no need to swipe thru multiple pages<br>Android apps seemed more refined than Apple apps and usually have more features/options<br>Android OS can be customized to user's liking<br><br>Negatives:<br>A lot of useless Samsung bloatware.  I don't need this crap.  Fortunately, it can mostly be hidden or disabled.<br>The speakers are not very loud.  Even at full volume it's hard to hear when driving around.<br>Curved screen.  Just don't like it.  I notice newer Samsung phones are going back to flat screen. Yay!<br>Sound setup in Android OS is a bit wonky.  Included sounds are pretty generic and lame.  Needs customization.<br>Camera is good but Android software is too busy; need to consolidate settings for more simpler interface; PRO mode is very nice feature<br><br>Wants:<br>Ability to remove icon text labels in Android - without having to use 3rd party utility\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Phone arrived, could not be used. Water damaged and never should have been sold.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phones were described on Amazon as ""GSM Unlocked - Verizon"" phones. The phones we received were not ""Unlocked"", but also were not Verizon phones. They were Xfinity Mobile phones. We could not get Xfinity service in our rural area, and they would not unlock them for non-customers. So we had to return them as soon as possible!\n</span>', '<span>\n  As others have said this is a really nice phone. However it does not come ready to just put in your sim card and use. I have T-Mobile and this phone came programmed to us cellular. I tried all of the quick fixes to no avail, the seller sent me some instructions that were very difficult to follow and this didn\'t change the network. I was about to return it and then ended up trouble shooting it online and about 3 hrs later I got it to work. This really isn\'t what you expect when buying an ""unlocked"" phone.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I received it in amazing condition no  Hairline fractures or imperfections at all, nothing at all was wrong with it . it's gorgeous, way better  Then Last one I purchased online I purchased Online through Amazon as a renewed of product.<br> It has no issues as of right now I've only had it for a week so far but hopefully nothing will come up. This  seller is the go to seller if you need a phone. They also have great prices and they're very good with their customer service.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  1/1/19, just set the phone up today. The phone was previously a T-Mobile phone. I cannot speak to whether it is truly unlocked, but I can say that it works perfectly with Straight Talk service. I purchased the refurbished S9 in Coral Blue to replace an S6 that was also on Straight Talk. The phone required a new SIM card, which I purchased through Straight Talk. I did use the T-Mobile compatible SIM that was in the activation kit. The Straight Talk website did not successfully complete the port of the phone number from the S6 to this S9, but a phone call to their customer service was successful. No additional settings had to be changed in order to use mobile data or send/receive MMS.<br><br>Accessories: The screen cover that came on the phone kept falling off, so I simply removed it. I wasn't expecting one to come with the phone anyway, so no harm no foul. I'll buy another to replace it. The charger was, in fact, a Samsung brand charger. The cord was wrapped in plastic as if completely new, and the brick was still sealed in its original bag. The phone did not come with any audio devices (e.g., earbuds/headphones), which is par for the course with refurbished phones.<br><br>Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  My old S7 was awesome but after 4 years it was done. 2 hours of talk time and it needed to recharged. I needed a phone to talk, text, take some pics, and pass the time on a plane playing a game or watching a movie. Phones are like cars at this point that they are expensive and depreciate quickly. I couldn\'t justify +1000 to replace my S7. I purchased this device 90 days ago and it is working perfectly. It looked new out of the box. (sorry for the pic quality but redoing the 70\'s kitchen) Did a battery wear check and still had +90%. If you need a new phone this is a ""no brainer"". I got what looks and functions as a new phone and kept $700 in my pocket.\n</span>']"

HOWEVER, may be listed as ""unlocked"" but spent 3 hrs. on chat/phone with Sprint an Oneplus only to find out not compatible with Sprint service - Sprint does not accept a phone purchased ""internationally"" (mind you through Amazon Services LLC, go figure).. Not sure if that is a Sprint thing, but both carriers and manufacturer should disclosed specs. that would prevent you from activating your phone in the US or wherever you\'re purchasing from and Amazon for sure should disclose the limitations/restrictions. I learned a-lot but I not enough...\n</span>', '<span>\n  I feel bad writing this review since the device is solid. However, BE CAREFUL as WiFi calling is not enabled if you’re on the AT&amp;T network. I know this is an AT&amp;T issue, and it really shouldn’t fall on One Plus. If it weren’t for this connection issue, I would have kept the phone.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I did so much research before settling on the 8t. I previously had a Google Pixel2XL but ruled out the 4a and 5 because they were not high end phones, even though it killed me to give up the Google automatic screen call feature. My decision came down to the 8t and the 8 Pro and I went with the 8t. The deciding factor was an incredible price on cyber Monday I could not resist. I am very happy with my purchase. The phone comes with all the bells and whistles I was looking for: latest Qualcomm 865 chip processor, 120 refresh rate, 12 RAM/256 storage, large and long life battery and the fastest charger out there. The OS system seems fine--glad it is Android 11.  Will have to see what happens with updates.  Still learning how to best utilize the cameras, which is not this phone's strongest feature. I know there are some complaints about the camera in the upper left corner but it doesn't really bother me and I believe you can adjust the settings to hide it.  It was fairly easy to transfer all my data using the OP app. The only problem I had initially was I could not receive text messages or VM notifications. After much research, I learned that this is not a CDMA phone so as soon as I called Verizon tech and explained my issue, they threw a switch and everything worked perfectly. It works fine with Android Auto. I also discovered that I had to clear the cache on each app I opened to get it to work properly. For the most part, its operation is fairly similar to the Pixel2XL. The fingerprint is on the front screen. It's easier to use than the Pixel2XL--i didn't think I was going to like it but I do...very user friendly. It has face recognition too but I haven't used it. The sound is excellent. On phone calls, the connection is clear, although I sometimes get an echo. Haven't tried it with ear buds yet. No headphone jack.  The settings are easy to go through and adjust. Battery life is excellent and it charges in minutes, thanks to the super charger. No wireless charger but I can live with that. It's not too large and fits in my back pocket...it is an extremely solid-feeling phone...not cheaply made. It comes with a screen protector already installed. I purchased an Otto screen case to protect the outside. Screen is sharp and bright. Customer service and support is excellent and you get to join a community forum if u want. There's lots of technical info on the site. There is a way to add the Google automatic screen call system using Magisk modules but I haven't had a chance to do that yet. Still have a ways to go to learn everything about this phone but so far, I'm really enjoying the functions. I can highly recommend this phone...it's one of the best for 2019-20...\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Great phone so far, worked with Verizon, after you get them to change a setting on their end, super fast no bloatware, except netflix lol.

This is much faster\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Bought directly from Amazon and was sent the kb2001 (indian) model not the US unlocked model as I was supposed to get.

I am very disappointed and will be returning it.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I bought this directly from OnePlus and was really looking forward to a decent upgrade from my Pixel 3XL.  Basically, I am generally let down by the phone.<br><br>Sure the basics are there, I'm not a game player so maybe it's great for that.  5G is non-existent in my neighborhood so maybe that makes it awesome.  The screen looks nice but so did my Pixel 3XL.  It doesn't feel faster at all and the bugginess of it compared to the Pixel is sad.<br><br>Google maps, when you switch away and the small screen comes up touching on it makes it disappear rather than bring back maps.  I use Google maps ALL the time and this is annoying as hell.<br><br>Keyboard in text messaging, I'd say over 50% of the time the keyboard doesn't pop up when you click on the text box, I have to try to attach a file/image then switch back to keyboard to get the keyboard to work.<br><br>Bluetooth - when I'm playing my podcasts via Podcast Addict the audio stutters just enough to be annoying the only fix was to turn off BT and the turn it back on.<br><br>Fingerprint reader is pathetic - the Pixel was ALWAYS ON POINT no matter how dirty my fingers were it JUST WORKED, this fingerprint reader is MAYBE 50% working.<br><br>Native navigation by using gestures makes apps gestures (like swiping right to bring up the many) no work any longer, yes you can turn it off but really you thought your gestures were more important than native Andriod functionality that many app makers use!<br><br>There's something wonky with the camera so when I try to deposit checks my bank app never recognizes the checks - again never a problem with my Pixel.<br><br>Sure there are some nice things - battery life is great.  Ok, that's all that I can say nice about it.<br><br>Overall if I could return this phone I would and I would HAPPILY go back to my 2 year old Pixel 3XL rather than have this device!\n</span>"", '<span class=""cr-original-review-content"">\n  Buen vendedor, recomendado, el producto llegó a tiempo, bien empacado y sellado.

Pretty much, there is no requirement for the carrier to accept connection from an ""unapproved device"" to their IMS. Without being registered on IMS, you miss out on a LOT of features. It\'s like having a new phone that runs on 10 year old cellular networks. I was very excited about this phone but this is a deal breaker. This really isn\'t 100% the phones fault but software could get around it. Maybe some of the other smaller carriers wouldn\'t have this issue or they would add the IMEI to their approval list. If it didn\'t have this issue, it would be a great value. Some might think data during calls isn\'t a deal breaker, but it causes other issues that you may not realize.

Advertise replaceable batteries but that's a lie too unless you want to order from another company that no one's ever heard of in another country. It's supposed to be professional work quality yet you can't seem to get any work done on it because it constantly crashes it sucked from day one but since the latest security update this is pretty much unusable. I bought this what's the dual SIM capability to upgrade from two very old phones to one new phone. Sadly the ancient technology I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and an iPhone 7 plus are light years ahead of this piece of trash. While looking in my account to see if there was still any option to return it I see there is a trade-in option LOL even Amazon knows this phone is a steaming pile of trash because they sell you a $500 phone and 3 months later they offer to let you trade it in on a new one for a value of $45\n</span>"", '<span>\n  So got this phone as my old one of 6 yrs finally crapped out after going through a dozen replaceable batteries and after I could no longer delete enough carrier bloatware to stop the phone from bogging down - did I mention it was old? So because of my job I needed a phone that can be used for 18 to 24 hrs without a charge and that means a replaceable battery - also nice to have extra storage in the form of an SD card as it allows one to avoid prematurely clogging up the device memory with all those 2 thousand songs and photos.<br><br>That pretty much limited my choices, buy an older phone model like the LG V20 which is old already, or buy a really old old model like the galaxy S5 like I just had - or buy the Samsung Galaxy xcover pro. So I got the xcover and got two extra batteries from England for 60 bucks delivered - they arrived in 3 days same day as the phone, (noice job there mates). Anyway getting the phone to work on Verizon (the only carrier that works reliably at my home) was an adventure. Couldn\'t swap the Sim card as the xcover takes a smaller one than the one in my old phone. Drove 30 miles to town to get a new Sim card - first place all out - drove 5 more miles to next place they had one. They put it in the phone activated it and started transfering data. Longer story short the new Sim was bad couldn\'t make or receive calls and once that was resolved still couldn\'t make calls until they found that the hd digital box had to be checked and activated on my Verizon account. After that it finally worked. So yeah, can\'t give it four stars as the phone came with no documentation - there is a manual online but you have to look for it - and it was real pain to get it to work - I certainly could not have done it on my own and was weirdly lucky to run into a computer/phone geek at the verizon store who took an hour to make it work, ""cause it should work.""<br><br>Using the phone is fine - a little bigger than I\'m used to but seems like most of the phones are all huge now-a-days. Love the replaceable batteries a real life and anxiety saver. Like the fast charge. Phone seems to work fast enough. Love the SD card just drop all the crap right on it. Can\'t speak to durability - like the claimed drop resistance, water resistance, etc.... But still got a case and a screen cover as crap happens.

The camera on this phone out performs the IPhone 12. All my friends with an IPhone were jealous of the camera. The camera is my favorite thing. 30× zoom is amazing. I could take pictures of animals from a good distance away without scaring them off. Incredible. I have had no trouble at all with this phone. There is zero lag. 120 hertz display is gorgeous. You will love this phone. It's a steal for 600 bucks\n</span>"", '<span>\n  i dropped the phone from literally less then a 1 foot drop and the camera cracked  theres no cases available for a couple more werks which is almost asking for people to break there devices, camera sucks, they expect you to not drop it when the material itself if very slippery and smooth, big fail from samsung i wpuldnt buy this phone save your money\n</span>', '<span>\n  Upgraded from an S9+ and while I was admittedly missing my old phone at first, the S20 FE has quickly won me over. The fingerprint reader works great, the screen is nice. I love the 120hz refreshrate. The camera is excellent with more features and capabilities than I know what to do with. The phone is slim; I put a thin case and some cheap screen protectors on the front and camera and it still feels nice. It is wider than the S9+, so that took some getting used to. The phone is quick and responsive and I have never felt that I am wanting for processing power or RAM. If you use your phone for basic things, this will suit you just fine.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Purchased the Samsung Galaxy s20 FE 5G  as an upgrade from a galaxy s9+. So far, this phone is awesome. Samsung makes the back out of metal instead of glass now, so that's a plus. The color red you see in the images is not the muted red you get in person. It actually looks kind of a metallic and immensely better!!!! There is not a tool in the box to open the sd drawer, it was fortunate we had one from a previous phone so we could activate it and insert the memory card. The charging cable is short, a longer one would be nice. I also like how Samsung did away with the curved edges on the screen.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  It came with open box ..im compeletly disappointed ...it seems to be refurbisehed so i had to return it . Besides i checked it out and it appears to be refurbished\n</span>', '<span>\n  I ended up returning this phone. It’s a really good phone but I just personally didn’t like how lightweight it felt and how large it was, or that the case was plastic. It’s a very beautiful color though. My biggest complaint is the camera quality. I am an artist and I just need my pictures to be perfect, I use the iPhone SE 2nd gen and in my opinion the camera on it is much better. The S20 FE camera is a bit lighter, a bit less saturated, and almost...grainy? I only notice when I zoom in on fine pencil lines etc. but I’ve heard other reviews complaining of the same differences. Anyway, if you want a feather light, huge, very pretty phone with a pretty good but not perfect camera, this phone is okay. Just not worth $600 to me personally.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I had earlier given this phone a 1 star when I thought it had no SD slot... but with the help of a friend... I located the slot behind the sim slot...<br><br>this would have been explicitly stated in a diagram... but that I did not see ... am updating my review to 4 Star will increase or decrease my rating based on how the phone performs.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I am coming from a Samsung 7 and loved it.  The battery was going and was debating of putting in another.  I decided to go with the 5G option.  It's the future.  Screen is beautiful, vibe, camera is better than the 7 which I thought was good.  Would buy again, and it was a great price when I purchased it.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  So let's start with the screen.  It's beautiful,  responsive, reads my fingerprints accurately. And it's got a lot of functionality with pip and other features.<br><br>Next up is signal.  I live in a rural area so service is tricky,  but this beast finds signal in all but the most taxing of conditions,  inside a manufacturing plant for example.<br><br>Camera is on the list too,  don't worry here we are. Overall it's a good camera.  It's not the best camera out the,  but it does a very fine job of trying to be the best. Many filters and functions await you here.<br><br>The battery is impressive.  I'm kinda hard on my phone battery,  and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time.  You get more features here too with power sharing and highly tunable battery saving options.<br><br>All in all,  I'm very satisfied with the phone and I'm sure many others feel the same.<br><br>P.S.  That Snapdragon is a monster.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This American version of this phone does not support a dual sim.  I am not sure why phone manufacturers think Americans do not want a dual sim capability, but I have two phone numbers and I want them in the same phone.  I sent it back.  Otherwise its a very nice phone.\n</span>']"

Honestly I can't imagine why anyone would need anything more then this phone. The specs beat a lot of flagship phones going for $800+ and the look of the phone on the outside does not come across as cheap. Only real complaint would be the earbuds that came along with it seem to have some defect and the right side is much much shorter from the point of the microphone to the earbud then the left side. And it's a shame too because the sound quality from the earbuds actually is pretty good compared to the earbuds that usually come with phones.

After two months of use she could no longer get service on the phone. After contacting T-Mobile it was revealed the there is a carrier block on the phone and it cannot be used because the previous owner never paid the phone off. Just be aware this could happen and verify that the phone is clear and unlocked.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The product came with a scratch and little divet on the screen. When I first got it, it had a screen protector on, so I thought the screen protector had the divet- nope.  After accidentally dropping it, my phone screen cracked right through the divet. I have not had this phone long and am pretty disappointed as It is not even usable now. Now the screen shows many lines of colors. I should have sent it back at the beginning when I saw the divet but was willing to work with it. Make sure you do your due diligence when you first buy it to send it back if there is any issues with the screen!<br><br>It’s a true unlocked Apple phone. Worked with at&amp;t and Verizon (we switched carriers).\n</span>', '<span>\n  When I got the phone, I was disappointed, but not surprised by the 85% capacity battery inside. I expected I’d be taking it in to Apple for a battery replacement, anyway. But, when I took it to Apple, they couldn’t replace the battery. They showed me pictures, where there was standing water and corrosion inside. Needless to say, I was shocked. Not only did I have the phone in a waterproof case, I only had it for a few days, and NEVER had it near water. I immediately contacted Amazon, who contacted the seller. The seller asked if I’d submerged the phone. I couldn’t believe it. After a few days of emailing, they agreed to a refund. I asked for a different phone with a full capacity battery as compensation. I use the phone for work. I missed out on money. They said they couldn’t oblige that. But, they did refund me promptly after reviewing the water damaged phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I am very very confused because I got an iPhone 11 Pro Max and not a red iPhone 8. But I don’t care it’s so much better\n</span>', '<span>\n  I had a great experience with this purchase thus far. After reading some reviews about possible issues I was concerned and contacted seller. They responded quickly (10-20min) with multiple questions I had and related information about the T-Mobile only iPhone I had purchased and made me feel very comforable with the purchase. A+ customer service was my experience and the phone is in great shape for ""renewed"". Will update if needed. With phone and network carriers it pays to do a little homework sometimes.\n</span>', '<span>\n  After paying a lot of money for a rush phone, I got it in and it has 2 large scratches on the screen.  I’m forced to keep it as I HAVE to have one for work so I paid for rush shipping and had to load all my stuff on it, but NOT worth this price with the scratched screen.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I ordered 2 phones, and should have expected the worst since what I got wasn't all that. One phone has a bunch of mini screen scratches, a few deeper ones, and an extremely deep one that was unavoidable (photos attached just of this one phone). Along with that, the phone came with a few dents and scratches around the edges anyway (which was ok and what I expected). The other phone I got had very very very few screen scratches and the minimal amount of expected dents on the side. On top of that, the way the home buttons felt when you pressed them felt different between the two of them. Both phones turned on fine, sound worked and touch screens worked normal. However I didn't even bother setting them up since I was going to return them.<br><br>Since this item is $150 less than a new iPhone 8, doesn't come with Apple charger or headphones, the price difference wasn't worth it in my opinion and I ended up returning both of the phones. I'm leaving two stars since one of the phones was in decent shape and since I expected to possibly return these phones anyway. Just expect the worst but low-key hope for the best because in my case with was pretty much night and day between the two phones.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone arrived a day before; looked brand new; and worked perfectly... For the first 2 days. In just 2 days the screen has went black and stopped working. The phone is still on as it had 80% charge and it is vibrating when I touch the home button, but the screen does not work. I am now turned off by the whole experience as the phone looked perfect and stopped working out of nowhere.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I bought the iPhone 8 256. It looked like new when I received it. It did not come in the original iPhone box. It came in a cardboard box with the plug in to charge it and the little metal piece for SIM card. It worked great in every aspect except that I noticed the sound quality was not as good as my iPhone 5s, the sound was more “tinny” sound, probably not noticeable to others, but it was for me. I don’t know if it was a defect or how the iPhone 8 was made. It just startled me when I would use it for an alarm clock playing music. I did not have any problem at all returning the iPhone. The package came with a card that had their phone number and email address, backed by Amazon. There is a 90 day warranty and I turned it back in shortly before the 90 days was up. When I spoke with the customer service, they were really nice and just wanted to know what was wrong with the iPhone. I was sent an email with the return label and I sent it back with no problem and got a full refund. Even though the phone did not work out for me, I would still recommend this company because of their great service and following through with what they say they will do.\n</span>']"

I tried putting in my Sim card, but it was not supported for Republic Wireless.  Returning, will update review if I have any problems getting my money back.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I moved from Galaxy S7 edge to a Galaxy 10e, so I\'m not sure how valuable my review would be to someone. The S10e is great. Here\'s a brief punch list of my impressions:<br>Thumbprint reader on the upper right side: Some people say it is not convenient, but I think it is immeasurably better than the front lower reader on the S7 edge. On the S7 edge I have to shift my pinky to hook the bottom edge of the phone so I can re-position my hand and place thumb on the reader, then I have to move back to my normal holding position. On the S10e, my thumb is already in position- no shifting necessary. The S10e reader is much faster and accurate.<br>Face recognition: My S7 edge did not have this feature. I had no idea how convenient face recognition could be! What a time saver!<br>Size: The S10e is smaller than the S7 edge, but the diagonal screen dimension is slightly larger. The screen width of the S10e is slightly narrower than that of the S7 edge.<br>Screen: The S10e has a lower screen resolution than my S7 edge, but I can\'t say I tell there is a difference to my naked eye. I knew this going in and chose the lower resolution for faster response, lower battery drain, and lower price. One thing I can tell is the difference in the ""immersion"" factor. The very curved S7 edge screen edges make the image somewhat more ""immersive"" than the flat screen of the S10e, but this is no big deal for me. The front camera makes a black  ""hole"" in upper right of the display, but this hole does not distract me.<br>Battery: Without using power-hungry apps and only a few ""normal"" apps, it took 58 hours for the battery to drain from  100% to 5%, which is impressive compared to my S7 edge. Power-hungry apps drain the battery as you expect. I will continue to carry a power bank in my briefcase when traveling just-in-case (or maybe get a battery case)<br>Charging Port: The USB-C on the S10e is a better charging port than the micro-USB on the S7 edge. I bought a pack of micro-USB to USB-C adapters (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYR5F2X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and I am using my old charging cables with no problem.<br>Camera:  I have only taken a few snapshots with the S10e, so I don\'t have anything to say. The specs of the S10e camera are better than the specs on the S7 edge camera, so I\'m sure all will be fine.<br><br>Summary: I bought the S10e as a ""renewed"" item on Amazon, and I am very happy with the phone and the price. After always being 2 to 3 generations behind in phone technology, I finally ""caught-up"" to the present, and did so at a reasonable price.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I read many other descriptions and figured I would risk it for the price.<br>The phone was not unlocked, it was an AT&amp;T phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Got the phone, and everything was fine. But when I went to connect it with verizon, the customer service representative informed that the phone was black listed! This is a result of this phone being stolen property. SMH no one will connect a stolen phone, who ever sells these is a true piece of work\n</span>', '<span>\n  This is truly a reliable version. there is no need for buying the S10 . The S10e is very reliable and the battery is literally all day of use! when the battery is at 10% - I can get 5 hours out of use! I will  not be upgrading anytime soon.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was so worried that the phone was only going to be carrier unlocked, but it did come factory unlocked. It had no scratches and was ready to set up from the start.  My battery life lasts  1.5 days with regular use of many apps. It charges wireless and with a cord. I am very satisfied with my purchase. It also came a day early.\n</span>', '<span>\n  It may depend on which seller is unloading these. My phone was tied to an account that had a balance due to Verizon. They will not activate these. Big waste of time.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I bought a phone. Was in excellent condition. Battery life seemed to be near 100%. Absolutely no scratches or blemishes. However, the phone was still attached to the previous owner's Sprint account.

A recording said that the company has blocked all calls. So we have a 30 mile drive to have it activated and this was our second phone the first had a faulty SIM card reader. After my own research I found where a reviewer had a similar issue with a Straight Talk phone and said it was unlocked. We took the chance and drove in and it was simple to have activated. The phone itself is great. My son is leaving tomorrow for college out of State and we needed this to work.

It seems to be related to a couple of particular locations/stretches of road. Thankfully, it seems to get okay reception at my house, but every time I\'m on the phone when driving it drops calls in certain areas. I consistently used my S7 without issue in the same locations, which leads me to believe there is something wrong with the design of the S10 that makes it work worse in areas with weaker signals.<br><br>I get that the curved edges are supposed to increase the viewing space for a screen, but when I\'m looking at white screens with text (most articles, etc.) there\'s a somewhat distracting, bluish haze where the light is bent around the curved edges. Similarly, on some websites the first letter and last letter of each line of texts gets cut off/distorted as it tries to wrap around the edge. Doesn\'t happen all that often, and I\'m getting used to the light refraction, but definitely annoying.<br><br>I\'m also nervous it will be more prone to breaking since all the cases I\'ve tried don\'t seem to have much of a raised bezel along the sides (since that would somewhat defeat the purpose of those fancy edges.)<br><br>Photos I\'ve taken so far have been really sharp and attractive without any additional editing, even when zoomed slightly and in low lighting. Haven\'t experimented with all of the features yet, but I like the ones I\'ve used so far.<br><br>Battery life has been pretty good--obviously it drains faster when I use it for things like Netflix, but I can go to bed with it at 15% and still have it at 13-14% when I wake up so a big improvement over my last phone (which to be fair was quite old.)<br><br>Refurbished, but looked like new so no complaints there.

Runs fast like a new phone. There are no scratches anywhere and I checked thoroughly. However, the major issue, why I only gave it 2 stars is that the phone I received is not unlocked. It is still registered to the Sprint network. I was told by my carrier Boost mobile and Samsung themselves to contact Tmobile to get the phone truly unlocked so I could use it but when I went to Tmobile they told me they couldn't do anything. That I would need to wait a year before I could use my Boost SIM card with the device as apparently there is a waiting period before a newly unlocked phone can be used on a new service. I contacted the seller to hopefully get a replacement with a phone that is actually unlocked and I'm waiting to hear back from them. It's annoying though.

I really do love this phone and definitely recommend buying it! Don't let the old negative reviews make you question this phone cuz it's a great purchase for me! The screen works beautifully and has no scratches (same with the back of the phone). The battery life is pretty good; better than I thought it would be. I would say the finger print reader is good but face recognition is not to great. It works but isn't the best. Other than that, this phone is awesome and like I said before, I SO recommend buying this phone!!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  There's lots to like and dislike about the S10, my biggest gripe is the finger print reader. Samsung did far better with having it on the back with the S9. The S10 on screen finger print reader makes unlocking the phone much slower, and protecting the screen with tempered glass much more difficult, and far more expensive. Which probably also played a role in why we're able to purchase these renewed phones, more people are damaging their screens. The unit I received has numerous scratches on the screen. I've haven't returned it yet, but I don't see myself being comfortable keeping it, in fact I'm probably better off getting another S9. The S10 has faster scrolling, a slightly better camera, but it's not dramatically noticeable. The S9 crushes the S10 in fingerprint reading which gets you into your phone, and apps with ease. The S10 you're gonna be doing a lot more finger print reading failure, and that will slow you down.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  When I first saw the phone and shipping was for Friday (perfect!

I called the company and they assured me if I ordered within the next 30 minutes they would make sure it got shipped out and make it here Friday, so much as to tell me to call back in an hour to confirm, which they did and it arrived on time!!!<br><br>Now the phone... I\'m not sure whats ""renewed"" about it, besides a very minor scratch by the headphone port, that my case covers anyways the phone is completely flawless, brand new quality, popped the sim in and ran right away, when it restarts it says ""no sim detected"" but by the time everything is loaded up its found it and is good to go.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  When I received the phone, it came in an original S10 box and came with mostly OEM (Samsung) accesories like a pair of AKG earbuds, a Samsung fast charger and a type - C cable, along with a user manual and other documents. The only non-OEM accesories I got were third-party USB to USB C adapter and a screen protector. The phone itself had no visible signs of damage and, as I'm writing this review, I have been using this phone for about 3 days. I have had no issues with this phone so far but I will update this review if I so. As for the performance of the S10, I'm quite sure I could get at least 1 day of use of this phone if I lowered my usage a bit and used the screen at the 1080p or 720p resolution. After the recent Android 10 update, which gave this lineup of phones many more features that can also be found on the new S20 lineup, I'd say you should also consider this phone, as on average, these will be around $200-400 less than its younger counterpart and you will recieve similar features. One last thing to note, however, (and maybe this is just me incorrectly using the phone) is that the fingerprint reader usually takes a good bit to read (about 3 seconds for me, which is a lot more than what I'm used to from my S8) and semi-frequently fails to read my print at all.\n</span>""]"

The iPhone 8 was priced right and I'm very happy with it.  The hardest part of the upgrade was getting the sim card tray to open on my old phone.  My previous phone was also a refurbished unit which worked flawlessly for nearly four years.  I've had the new phone for about a week now and there is a lot of new functionality that I have yet to use so it will keep me entertained for a while becoming familiar with them.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I ordered a red i8 to replace a i5. I was not expecting to be surprised by reading the reviews.

Set it up in no time every thing is working  flawlessly I’ve had it a few weeks and no issues yet. Will repost if anything goes wrong\n</span>', ""<span>\n  A word to the wise, have BREED check the IMEI of what they're sending you. IMEI's are specific to GSM or CDMA, and even if the phone is fully unlocked, if the IMEI doesn't match, it won't work. For example, Verizon and Sprint have compatible IMEI's, and AT&amp;T and T Mobile are compatible.<br><br>I got a phone, and the IMEI did not work with my network, which is how I learned about all of this.<br><br>A word on BREED, though. They are very easy to talk to, and very helpful. I doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network. I returned my phone with no problems, and they were very understanding about the difficulty.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Have only had the phone a couple of days but so far it works great.  It is an iPhone 8, 64GB model.  It looks brand new and everything functions as it should.  A note to Straight Talk users.  That is my carrier and when I put my Straight Talk SIM card in this phone it works great but I went to the Straight Talk website and logged in so I could transfer my new phone and register it.  The website kept giving me an error when I entered the phone\'s IMEI or serial number so I called Straight Talk support.<br><br>After working with me for a while, the rep said ""You can\'t use your current SIM card because you have an unlocked phone.  You are going to have to buy a new SIM card and then register that and the new phone with our ""Bring Your Own Phone"" system on the website.""  I asked if I did that could I keep my phone number and he said yes.  I did some research online and got the impression the the Bring Your Own Phone is not for existing customers, but for new customers or existing customers with new phones who want new phone numbers.  Not sure about that, but my thought is that since the phone works perfect as it is, I am not going to try to upset the apple cart by buying a new SIM and trying to register it with Straight Talk.  I think they don\'t want us users to have unlocked phones and especially ones that were not purchased through the Straight Talk website or an authorized supplier so I am leaving well enough alone.  The phone works fine with my SIM card, the only thing is that on the Straight talk website it shows I have a Samsung Galaxy instead of an iPhone 8.  No harm, no foul.\n</span>', '<span>\n  My phone was delivered in a timely manner and came in nice packaging. No scuffs or scratches on the screen or outside of the phone. I’m very content with the condition of this phone and it was easy to set up with the existing sim card I had in my old phone through Verizon! I will never buy a brand new phone from the store again! I do need to invest in a converter or some new headphones for the new port.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Buy this one! Everything should work this well.\n</span>', '<span>\n  After only 5 months, the refurbished iPhone 8 has died. Two updates and two restores failed.  $599 down the drain.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Phone arrived on time, and looked completely new.  Was easy to set up and worked exactly as expected.  After two weeks, if I was out and was carrying the phone in a bag it would begin to randomly execute functions.  Initially I thought I had been hacked, but I read on line that this probably means the screen installation is faulty.  Unfortunately this happened  while I was on vacation, so I ended up being without a cell phone during my trip whenever I was out of the house.  It also deleted all my music (which I was able to re load when I returned home).  It then took another week to call and obtain the postage paid label and buy a replacement phone once I returned home, so I was without a mobile phone for several weeks.  I have bought refurbished phones in the past without any problem.  I intend to try again to buy a refurbished phone as it is the phone I want, it did look perfect, the battery life seems good, and the price is very good.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was hesitant to order bc of how long it said it would take to arrive, however it arrived in less than a week (a whole week earlier than expected). I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the phone. Not one single scratch on the screen, rear glass surface, or camera lens. There were some small surface scratches on the paint close to the camera lens, but that is to be expected with a refurbished phone. Other than that, it was in perfect condition. It is fully operational, and took the AT&amp;T SIM card that I had when I first tried it. Where I’m located, Verizon is the way to go bc AT&amp;T service sucks around here. When my Verizon sim arrived from straight talk, I popped it in and called the customer service line. She worked her magic and paired the phone’s IME number with the Verizon sim, and after about 20 minutes it was working perfectly on the Verizon sim. So when they say all carriers, it actually works on both AT&amp;T and Verizon carriers.<br><br>Also, I wasn’t even expecting a new cord and charger, but there it was in the box. I was also expecting to have to go find a paperclip to install my sim, but low and behold they included the sim removal tool too! For a 256Gb phone that is unlocked on all carriers, I’m extremely impressed. The battery had about 80% capacity, which is great too.<br><br>I’m excited to have a shiny new phone, and I didn’t have to pay an arm and a leg to one of the big cell companies or sign and contract to get it! I’m all about not signing cell contracts these days. So thank you for having great quality phones for purchase! I will purchase from them again in the near future when it’s time for me to upgrade once again\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Cell phones are like ladies. When they are young and fresh, you can't wait to play with it. You show it to your friends, take it everywhere, have some amazing times and great memories.<br><br>Time marches onward and technologies advance. Suddenly your cell phone is old and tired. Once the envy of your friends, it's now a joke. You finally turn it in.<br><br>Then there are those who buy a refurbished phone. Like a MILF, the phone can still provide some good times but you are only kidding yourself. The best days are gone and you will only be frustrated when it breaks down and becomes nothing more than a pain in your ass.<br><br>Both phones I received were worn out. The first phone's camera did not work and the replacement was DOA. It's best to buy a new cell phone and not waste your time buying refurbished junk.\n</span>""]"

Activation was easy, just switch out SIM card.  Had it only a few days but so far very pleased.  Will provide update if my opinion changes. For now, this is a deal that you can't pass up.<br><br>10/29/19 Have increased my rating by 1 star to 5.  Had the phone about a month now and am very happy with it. Had an issue with a bad cable, would charge but my PC would not recognize the phone when connected via USB. Seller identified the issue quickly and provided me with a resolution that is satisfactory to both of us.  I will be buying from this company in the future.  BTW, I got in touch with seller via amazon's order summary page and the Contact Seller link.  Very easy. Hybrid IT got back to me within an hour!!!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  While I do feel you are playing a little lottery when buying renewed, I do believe that odds are in your favor that you will receive a device virtually indistinguishable from what you\'d get new out of the box at hundreds less.  I thought for sure mine would have at least some ""hairline"" scratches or at least SOME kind of minor cosmetic flaw, but it was flawless!  This might actually be the way I buy phones in the future as well.<br><br>Thanks to being IP68, one of the first things I did was wash it off under the faucet.  The little adhesive stickers at the bottom were a little obnoxious, but I was able to completely remove them and rub off the remaining adhesive.<br><br>Expect LOTS of system updates when you start this thing up.  There were 3 something system updates before I was even presented with the major Android 10 update (which is fantastic btw).  Then there were another 1 or two after that!<br> Battery life also seems really solid -- something I was concerned with being pre-owned.<br><br>Coming from an S8, the biggest difference I noticed is the UI.  The Snapdragon 855 is also significantly faster, though you won\'t notice a difference in most cases.  Didn\'t test the camera much, but it\'s supposed to be considerably better.  The wide angle less is also nice addition.  As someone who prefers my phone naked, it\'s much easier to use in hand thanks to NOT having curved edges.  Fingerprint reader also has a faster/accurate unlock than its other S10 siblings.  Overall I wouldn\'t consider this a huge leap over the S8, but it does offer enough new to appreciate.  The S8 is still an incredible phone even by 2020 standards.<br><br>My budget allowed for any phone, but chose the S10e because I believe it\'s the best in the whole bunch.  I don\'t need the optical zoom, 8GB of RAM, or in-display fingerprint reader as found in the other models.  Plus the S10e is the perfect size.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Sold as unlocked.

After hours and hours and hours and hours and hours on the phone and at the Verizon and T-Mobile stores, was told there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to switch ALL of my service over to Verizon for 4x as much money.

It looks and works just like a new one. It came packaged well with a new third party charger and adapter. I love it with all my heart :^) Dont be scared by some of the reviews. I dont know if I just got lucky but I have Verizon and changed my service to this phone with absolutely no problems.<br><br>On the customer service tip, I did have a hard time getting the sd card slot out (which I guess is harder than my previous phone because of the build). I thought it was stuck so I called the number listed on the little pamphlet that came with my order. This lady that sounds like she just woke up in her living room answers the phone. She had an attitude as soon as she started talking. Was probably the rudest customer service person I\'ve ever spoken with in my life. Everything she said was rude and at times she seemed like she was half laughing like something was funny. When I told her my problem (for the second time, because she ""couldn\'t understand me"" the first time), she said ""Well I don\'t know what you expect me to do, I don\'t have the phone in front of me."" When I asked her if I should just force it she repeated that same thing and added that if I forced it and anything broke I couldn\'t return it, and that I should watch a youtube video on how to get it to work!!<br><br>Overall I\'m very happy with my new phone, but cross your fingers that it works right and be prepared to return it lol.\n</span>']"

Seller said if I'm satisfied, to keep the one I received. I'm using. Much better call quality, listening on phone and what others I call hear, than my 5 year old S5. I replaced the S5 because I can't get batteries that work for it- all sold now are weak and fail quickly. Maybe there was something wrong with the S5 when I bought it new at Verizon.

The 3 generation difference is huge as the screen resolution, battery life, and camera functions have all been upgraded to the top of its class. Just keep in mind that the USB charging wires have been upgraded to the 3.0 series so the old charging cords will not be compatible with this phone. Having had the phone for nearly 6 months, I can say with conviction that I would purchase this phone again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a top notch phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Our cheap cell phone company only offered old phones for upgrades at inflated prices, so we bought a pair of these instead and did the ""Bring Your Own Phone"" thing. Last year, these were the top-rated Android phones.  They really packed a bunch of features into such a small package.  I recommend going to YouTube and search for Samsung Galaxy S9. You\'ll find lots of information about the abilities and cool features of the phone.<br><br>You can wirelessly charge these phones.  We bought phone cases [Galaxy S9 Case, YOUMAKER Heavy Duty Protection Kickstand with Built-in Screen Protector Shockproof Case Cover for Samsung Galaxy S9 5.8 inch (2018 Release)].  These cases are a bit thick in the back, so if you want to enjoy the convenience of wireless charging, you\'ll need a stronger charger like this one: ""Yootech Fast Wireless Charger with Cooling Fan, Qi-Certified 10W Wireless Charging Stand with Quick Adapter,Compatible with iPhone XS MAX/XR/XS/X/8/8Plus, Galaxy S10/S10 Plus/S10E/S9(with Adapter)"".<br><br>Compared to our old phones, the screen is much clearer and crisper. It turns on and off faster, and oh my heavens, after I loaded all the apps I want, I still have gigabytes of storage available. My old phone had ONE app because the rest of the space was taken up by factory-installed apps.  There\'s loads of improvements in the operating system, too, from the older version.  You\'re going to like it.  Your phone will arrive way behind on the OS updates, make sure you do software updates!\n</span>', '<span>\n  My phone came in generic packaging marked ""Renewed (NEW)."" After examination of the hardware and software, I found no indication that the phone wasn\'t completely new and unused. Certainly, the physical condition was absolutely flawless and it was fully unlocked. You can, by the way, check the unlock status of an S9 by dialing this code: *#7465625#.<br><br>The problem was that the phone was carrier specific and setup for the Xfinity network. Initially, no matter what SIM was in it, it booted as an Xfinity phone and had trouble maintaining a connection to the cell system. Oddly, with an AT&amp;T SIM, data would work, but not voice. But maybe that was just a bad SIM. In any event, all issues were ultimately resolved. Once a working SIM was installed (I used a Straight Talk SIM kit with a new phone number so I could debug without causing loss of service issues with my existing phone number), the phone began a long sequence of auto-updates. A few went by before I noticed a release date: June, 2018, so I don\'t know what the first one was. March 2018, maybe. Anyway, from there, updates were downloaded and installed for July, August, September and so on. Throughout these ""monthly"" updates, there were still issues with bootup as an Xfinity phone and problems maintaining a connection to the cell network. Finally, a huge January 2019 update was installed which included an extensive revision to the OS (Pie). After that, the Xfinity boot was gone, voice and data connections were stable and everything was operating normally.<br><br>I\'m not a cell phone expert, but my best guess is that the problems prior to the January 2019 update were somehow related to the OS\'s security system being unable to properly cope with finding a non-Xfinity SIM in an Xfinity tailored phone, unlocked status notwithstanding. So, moral of the story: keep running the updates until you\'ve got the all-important January, 2019 installed. Be patient, you might have to wait through a LOT of updates to get there -- it was something like 11 or 12 for me. By the way, the latest update as of today is July 2019. So from unpackaging to fully up to date, I had to install something like 18 or 19 system updates.<br><br>So there you go. A real phone bargain can be had, you just have to work a bit more than you might have expected to get it.\n</span>']"

The battery lifespan on the phone when I got it says 90%.  Not bad at all!  No scratches, no dents, looked pretty much new.  Saved hundreds and now I have the phone I wanted with 256gb to download anything under the sun which is why I replaced my old phone that only had 18gb.  My work would only allow us to get the 18gb iPhone which really annoyed me but I understood why.  So I took it upon myself when the battery started going to get my own phone &amp; just pay for it myself.  We use AT&amp;T as a provider at my work, so all I needed to do was take out the SIM card from my old iPhone and put it in this 256gb beast....I’m so happy I did.  So far so good.  I recommend this seller for sure. Great product! I will update this review down the line if I end up having any problems out of the ordinary.  Hope this review helps as I was very skeptical in buying used and saw some reviews that aided me in making this purchase.  Also, I purchased using my Amazon credit card which allows you to make 12 monthly payments around $30/month at 0% interest.  I can’t lose!!!  That’s the cost of 10 coffees at Starbucks a month.  I’ll enjoy my own brew for a year to offset the costs.  Okay, I’m done.  Now I just sound like a bag of hot air.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I gave this phone a 1 only because the seller is not describing it properly.  It is a gsm phone and, as such, does not work on Verizon or Sprint the same way a Verizon or Sprint phone will work.  Those carriers use CDMA phones, so a gsm phone will not get the same coverage.  It worked in as far as I could get it activated to make calls, receive texts and be fully functional, but only in certain areas.  I had an iPhone6 &amp; an iPhone 4 before that, both with Verizon &amp; both of those worked all the time at my boyfriend\'s house &amp; never once lost service in 6 years.  Then I bought this phone &amp; had service fine until I got to his house &amp; then my phone said ""no service"".  It did this repeatedly for a few days every time I went to his house &amp; stayed that way the whole time I was there even though my boyfriend\'s Verizon iPhone 8 worked in the same house at the same time &amp; never lost service.  I called Verizon &amp; they said this phone was a T-Mobile phone &amp; is a gsm phone &amp; explained that if I want the same level of coverage I had before I need an unlocked phone that was originally a Verizon phone so that it is a CDMA phone.  I guess an original Sprint phone would work, too, since those are CDMA phones.  I told Amazon that they need to require the sellers of cell phones to identify the phone as gsm or CDMA.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone could text and call but could not connect to cellular data. Defective and not as described and now I don’t have a phone for 5-6 days until I can get this replaced.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I would give this seller a 0 star in everything if I could. Do not buy from this seller they sell you unpaid iPhones and they are not locked. They can’t be connected because they are not paid off so basically useless.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone initially worked just fine and I was able to make a few phone calls after getting a sim card from my carrier. A few hours later, however, I realized I wasn\'t getting authentication text messages while trying to set up social media apps. While trying to make a test phone call, I was redirected to my carrier\'s customer service line. The representative informed me that the phone\'s IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number had been blacklisted as lost/stolen and that I would be unable to use the device until it had been removed from the blacklist by either Apple or Verizon (the former carrier). This is unacceptable considering I paid for a fully unlocked phone. On top of that, the headset speaker sounds tinny as if it was damaged from playing music too loudly. Phone calls are nearly unintelligible and music quality sounds worse than my iPhone 5s. I am very disappointed overall with this ""Renewed"" product that Amazon stands behind.\n</span>', '<span>\n  very disappointed to see i that its defective. works totally find except that it restarts itself every one or two minutes and the batter says its dead even when its fully charged i guess this happens sometimes so ill try one more time with this seller\n</span>', ""<span>\n  this says fully unlocked but when I called boost mobile to switch phones they said they cannot be used with boost mobile.  very disappointed because the phone is great looking.  I ordered a different iPhone 8 fully unlocked and I hope that I don't have the same problem\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The phone was beautiful and perfect in great condition! However, the shutter sound would not mute, which meant it was probably from Japan where it is illegal to mute the camera shutter sound. You can't even turn it down. There was NOTHING I could do to mute the sound. I tried everything, even running it on another app. I returned the phone...I was sad because it was perfect. If you don't mind the sound, you should but it...be beware!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This is the real thing. Phone works perfectly. It is AT&amp;T locked as described, but not a problem if you have them as your carrier.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was sold a phone that had A REMAINING BALANCE with tmobile!!! I wasnt even able to activate the phone because they needed to be paid for the phone!! Absolutely furious about it, it was a gift that they cant even use!

But everything is functioning now.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Don't order from we deliver wireless.

I got it a few days ago and opened it expecting it not to be up to my standards but was surprised when it looked almost brand new. You can definitely see that it's been used, has typical signs of wear on the case and screen. There is one small gouge on the top of the case by the speaker, but with a phone case on you can't really see it. I have Straight Talk, so I bought the bring your own phone kit and was able to get my service transferred to the phone very easily with no issues. Only thing I didn't like was the T-mobile start up screen, but I can live with it because it doesn't have T-mobile service lol. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and the phone 😊\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone was in excellent cosmetic condition - no cracks or scratches.  Unfortunately, it would just restart on its own.  The first time it restarted was during the initial setup when it was in the middle of upgrading the o/s.  After it was setup it would restart several times a day during the 3 days I had it.  Sometimes when I was using it and at other times it could just be sitting there idle and it would happen.  I never had this problem on my S7 and I ended up just biting the bullet and going to Verizon and buying a new one which works perfectly.  It\'s a shame that the problem was not identified during the ""renewal"" process and the problem wasn\'t corrected or the phone deemed unworthy of resale. The seller did accept the return and refunded the purchase price with no hassle.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Received the supposedly reconditioned phone.  Unfortunately, nither the cellular or LTE service would stay active.  Calls would disconnect after 1-2 minutes, and cell service would drop out completely.  Same for the networking service.  Data service would continue to drop off.  Worked with the carrier T-Mobile, and confirmed after full network resets, new SIM cards, and hours of troubleshooting, that the phone was defective.<br><br>When purchasing a reconditioned device, you roll the dice.  I took that chance, and would have been OK with trying again.  Unfortunately, after eventually getting a hold of the supplier, seems like I can return it, but doesn't look like a replacement is available.  Go figure.  Avoid the supplier and if possible, avoid doing these reconditioned phones.  Chances are, you will roll snake eyes.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I really like this phone so far. I don't know all there is to know yet but as I go along I'm sure I will discover things it does. It has a curved edge and i thought the S 10 + was the one that had the curves. But I'm learning to live with it. The battery seems to last a little longer than my S7.  I'm glad I have more storage space. As far as it being refurbished i don't think I went wrong there. I did notice that there were 2 hairline scratches on the screen but when I put the screen protector on you can't see them.  All and all I'm satisfied with the phone.\n</span>""]"

They have the latest Samsung diagnostic tools and firmware for Samsung phones.  Everything else works perfectly.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I bought this renewed phone and received an S10e in beautiful condition. When I had fully charged it and turned it on, the AT&amp;T logo showed and I thought I might have a problem since I am using Total Wireless, a second tier carrier that uses the Verizon network. I ended up returning what was most probably a perfectly good item due to my service providers dropping the ball. They said the phone was incompatible and, I have since come to believe that was not the case.<br><br>The listing included Verizon among the compatible carriers. Upon activation, I was able to make and receive calls but I had no 4g/LTE data connection, just WIFI. After delving into the problem with a customer service agent, I was advised that the phone was incompatible. AT&amp;T uses GSM and Verizon uses CDMA so I thought the incompatibility verdict seemed reasonable.<br><br>In working with the carriers CS agent, he had me go into settings&gt;connections&gt;mobile networks&gt;network mode. There you will see a list with one of the choices checked indicating the setting the phone is on. He told me to select ""Global"" . When I told him there was no ""Global"" or ""LTE/CDMA"" selection, he said the phone was not compatible.  Pic 1 is my old S6, which I am replacing, and Pic 2 is the S10e.<br><br>The CS agent also had me go into the Access Point Names. There was no access point listed, just some text saying ""not available to this user"" or something similar. No further input at all from the agent  on the access point angle, or why phone calls were working but not data, just ""the phone is not compatible"" Looking back now, at this point the agent should have walked me through setting up an access point. He didn\'t, so I sent back my ""incompatible"" phone.<br><br>There was no problem at all returning the phone over the incompatibility issue. I then bought a second, used S10e from a different listing that described a Verizon phone so I figured I would be all set. Sure enough, it is a Verizon phone but imagine my surprise when I  encountered the exact same problem.<br><br>Long story short, the FIX was that I need to manually set up/add an access point. I touched/opened the access point on my old S6 and replicated the settings  into the ""add access point"" on the S10e, and everything works fine.  I got the idea for the fix from a YouTube video. I guess they don\'t watch YouTube over at Total Wireless.<br><br>I am certain this fix would have worked on the first, ""incompatible"" phone I ended up returning. I have since learned that the access point settings are supposed to download automatically on activation, but sometimes they don\'t. I would have expected a higher level of competency from my service provider\'s customer service. Ya Think?<br><br> I can\'t help thinking that issues like this are deliberate corporate curveballs, designed to encourage customers to buy new phones direct from the carrier. JMHO<br><br>To sum up my review of this phone, I received an S10e in top notch condition and would highly recommend this renewed product.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Perfect phone came just as described. It was unlocked and ready to use. Looks like new with only a small scratch on the back, but not really noticeable at all.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  the seller.  The phone (I ordered the white prism) is lovely.  Packed well in a sturdy plain box, one protective cellophane sleeve inside a bubble wrap sleeve and accompanied by a charger and cord (no sim card tool). It arrived a day or two early even!  The start-up was smooth for the first few seconds... and then I saw VERIZON on the screen.  I thought, well maybe it'll still work.  (I'm a Consumer Cellular customer and my service provider through them is T-Mobile.)  I tried to continue the set-up process.  In an instant a message popped up from Verizon telling me (in other words) that the phone wouldn't work with the sim card I just inserted.

The phone Samsung S10e is first of all, an amazing phone all around. It meets my standard of a good Samsung quality. I loved how it looks and feel of it all. The phone itself is very snappy and I had it all set up for a long time use but then... I was disappointed.<br><br>Main 2 issue I had with this phone are Battery life and power. When I first received the phone it was completely dead no power at all but I was like okay maybe it just needs to charge.. so I did. After while I have been using it for a day or two.. it was great but realized the battery drains quickly.. and phone turns off abruptly when it’s not in use.<br>A good example I can say is whenI used the phone for good 1 hour or 2 watching videos, phone calls, text etc.. but when I set the phone down for bit and picked it back up it shuts down. When I turn it on it’s a big struggle. I would have to hold power for good 2 minutes or when I get frustrated I plug in power and then it actually turns on. It is extremely annoying and irritating especially when I need to use the phone in emergency case I cannot use it because phone abruptly turns off completely. The phone itself works perfectly fine when it is powered on but when it turns of it really turns off for good time until you press really good on the power and hope it will turn on again.. I hope to get a replacement from the seller because I really do like the phone I am just not happy with the main function that gives the phone its life.. battery and power.<br><br>PROS: Bright display, snappy function, internal functions great, cameras great, Sim Unlocked<br><br>CONS: Power Issue and battery life, some scratches..\n</span>', '<span>\n  So, let me start with for those that want a quick answer Hybrid IT is definitely a trusted seller as far as my Samsung s10e is concerned. My only regret is that I didn\'t get the regular s10 or even the s10 plus from them. I wish I could upgrade  but this ""renewed "" s10e is practically brand new. Now I\'ve had this phone for almost a month I wanted top write an honest and informative review because I hesitated and I kept thinking what if I\'m making a mistake. Well, Hybrid IT after reading their reviews and looking through multiple sellers I\'m glad I took a chance. The battery life is amazing the phone is a major upgrade from my Samsung S6, like I cannot emphasize it enough I am very very careful when it comes to spending more than a few hundred dollars on something. This phone from this seller well, I wish I would\'ve bought the s10. I immediately poot a screen protector and case on it and it\'s such a great upgrade the apps load so much faster I can actually watch shows at work now! Lol I know what a guy huh. It charges so fast and not to mention it has a little tab that you can pull from the right to left its SO  convenient. The screen is responsive I\'ve had no issues as far as speakers its actually pretty loud. The bluetooth functionality is actually much better than my S6 like seriously if you\'re debating on getting an upgrade for your old s6 or S7? As long as it\'s from Hybrid IT go big don\'t hesitate I wish I would\'ve they\'ll take care of you. It says ""renewed "" but trust me its practically brand new. Oh. One last thing when you order it keep an eye on your mailbox look for a little white box. The website will say one day but it might arrive earlier. Is not hard to imagine what is in a small box of that sort so just a head up.\n</span>', '<span>\n  \xa0I was so nervous ordering this phone but i am happy to say after 2 days of use, the phone works perfectly.<br>The phone also looks brand new. I am extremely happy!\n</span>', '<span>\n  This phone was supposed to be a US unlocked phone but when I got it it had Verizon wireless specific service and when I wanted to switch it to another service it was not compatible.\n</span>']"

I attempted to call the seller and my call immediately went to voicemail. I called Amazon and they were very helpful. The gal asked the company to email me and let me know she would call me back after two business days and if the seller didn't resolve the issue she would help me go from there. The seller ignored 8 of my 9 emails. They sent me one asking what the problem was and to send pictures. I sent four emails with detailed pictures and descriptions of the problems. Radio silence. I emailed again the next day to ask if they received my prior emails and they said no. I re-emailed everything again and still no response. Amazon was very generous and gave me a full refund on the damaged product, even though the seller had no interest in making things right. I'm grateful for Amazon's refund, as now that we have used this phone for a few days we have discovered that the headphone jack is loose and the headphones will just fall out and the speaker sounds staticy like it's blown and isn't very loud.

It took almost 2 hours of updates which brought the phone up to Android 9. All of the Verizon apps were gone, replaced by the T Mobile version of Android. So the phone I received was unlocked. I could have made phone calls right away without doing the updates if that is important to you. I used the Samsung app to transfer all my files, apps, and settings from my old phone, a Galaxy S6.  I do not have a landline, I connect the Galaxy S9 to the house cordless phones using Link to Cell built into the Panasonic cordless phone.  No problem.

First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it’s illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don’t know if that’s how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll😍. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there’s a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn’t work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its 💯 percent honest.<br><br>Edit- you can fix the camera sound by downloading apps such as Microsoft Pix which allows you to turn off camera shutter sounds, other than that you’ll have to jailbreak your phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  So happy with the seller and purchase! Shipping was slower than I would’ve liked but first world probs right? The phone was in amazing shape- no damage that I could find at all. I got the iPhone 8 silver and it’s fast, perfect and was such a great deal!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I received the iPhone 8 with a new/free screen protector installed. This was nice but unexpected. Upon closer examination I saw what appeared to be a small crack or deep scratch on the screen so I removed the screen protector and verified there was a small crack along with multiple scratches. The lightening connector port was also dirty and had scratches. Ultimately, I did not feel it met the standard of being renewed and not worth the money spent.  I am in the process of returning the iPhone 8 and will find another vendor.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Everything about this product has been perfect. The quality was indistinguishable from new, it has functioned reliably and perfectly since I received it. This would have been an easy 5-star review except for one thing:<br><br>This is a refurb unit from Japan, which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted, turned down, or turned off.<br><br>That one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me, as I primarily (used to!) use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes. Now a single exceptionally loud click sends every critter in the vicinity scurrying for cover.\n</span>', '<span>\n  (I bought this for my son to be placed on my current VERIZON network plan) ...so..ok, let me start by saying that i received the phone via 2-day Prime shipping. Phone came in a generic box, but sufficient for transport. It included the charger and 3ft charging cable. nothing else. Unboxed, the phone was in EXCELLENT cosmetic condition, not a single scratch anywhere. I powered it on, the display was beautiful and worked as it should. At that point I ran thru the setup and got the phone all setup for my son (its his b-day present) ... then I took the phone to VERIZON STORE and had them put a VERIZON SIM in it for activation and to be added to my current verizon plan ....WELL GUESS WHAT... this phone is a model A1905, and it is ONLY GSM carrier compatible, NOT CDMA, which is what verizon is.... but yet, this phone was advertised as "" FOR VERIZON"" , which is the ONLY reason I went ahead and bought it. The Verizon models are A1863 &amp; A1864. So I have given the review 2 stars because of the great cosmetic, great camera and fully functional condition , but because they LIED, and DID NOT send me what I purchased (a phone for VERIZON networks), I do feel that this is unacceptable that tey are allowed to Advertise one thing, then send you another. Where I come from we call that a big fat LIE!!! and I DO NOT put up with LIARS, therefore I  reporting themfor FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and hopefully they will be kicked off of AMAZON\n</span>', '<span>\n  Purchased iphone and was told phone was stolen and can not be turned on based on 15 digit code that comes with iphone.

The phone took about a week to ship out, but to be fair I ordered just before the Fourth of July and I can see how that would gum up the works. It arrived within a day of being shipped though, so that made up for it.<br><br>The phone looks immaculate (no scratches or dents). So far I've had no issues (though it's only been 24 hours). I booted it up, put in my sim, placed calls, sent texts, changed display settings, tested the speakers with my music, etc....anything I could really think to test I did. The phone came with the tool to open the sim tray, a USB plug, and charge cable (the plug and cable are not Apple products, which I expected, but since some reviews act surprised, I'll confirm for those of you who think that really matters).<br><br>There are two minor downsides. The battery capacity is only at 89% right now. While that's still entirely useable, at 80% the battery is essentially dead/needs replaced. So I've only got 9% to use, though I'm not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn't matter. The second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector, BUT, it's unfortunately the wrong size. Not sure if it's for the 8S or a newer iPhone, but it sure isn't for the regular old 8. I ordered a case anyway, so it's not really an issue for me.\n</span>"", '<span class=""cr-original-review-content"">\n  El teléfono pedido era de 256 GB y llegó de tan solo 64 GB.\n</span>', '<span class=""cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden""></span>']"

However, I pleasantly surprised to receive the phone with no visible scratches or marks. It booted up and worked seamlessly with my TMobile sim card. It\'s fast and sleek.<br><br>The not so good: After starting the device up, it started to look for recent updates and seemed to update. However, I received an error say ""Error: firmware cannot update."" Ever since, every 30mins-1hr it\'ll start trying to complete the update, and I\'ll receive multiple pop ups with errors. After 2 days I decided, it was too much of a nuisance to ignore and called Samsung tech support. I was told that the phone was originally registered with the service provider Sprint, and although Sprint may have unlocked the device there can be some restrictions still on it. Service providers are the ones who push out the updates apparently. I was told to call Amazon and request a phone that was originally with my current service provider.<br>Battery port: Not sure if all Samsung S10 battery ports are like this, but the slightest movement of the phone while it was charging would lead to a cease in charging.

I do wish that Galaxy kept the notification light, that was a huge bummer. But other than that, I cannot believe how great this phone is!!! I absolutely freaking love it so so so so so so much.

Not cool Google.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I got the phone very quickly, which was great. There were some scratches at the base, but I knew I was buying a used phone and I planned on putting a case on it anyway, so no big deal there. It came about 80% charged, so I charged it. However, it dies very fast. I've had it unplugged for about 2 hours now and lost 25% battery already. My vibrate call and message function doesn't work either. I contacted the seller first, and was told they couldn't replace or refund it because they don't have more in stock... Oddly, I can buy a new one exact color and gb as mine from them... Hmmm. I call shenanigans.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I realize it’s “refurbished” but I’m just curious...did you drop it from the top of the Empire State Building before you shipped it?\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Exactly as advertised. It's obvious that it's been refurbed. Great battery life still, and it's in great shape.<br><br>It's totally my fault for not reading more, but honestly I didn't know there were some Pixels with a locked bootloader...but apparently Verizon managed to talk Google into it. Jerks. Anyway I wish I could root, but honestly there's so much you can do without root now that it's not that big of a deal.<br><br>However, great as this phone is, next time I think I'll look at swappa first. I always use a case and screen protector, and probably wouldn't even notice minor blemishes. I could've gotten the verizon model for $120, or the rootable version for $180.<br><br>One thing: it does come with a generic charger and USB-C cable, which I don't trust. I mean the charger is fine...but I've only ever used an Anker cable with it. I can't say for sure, but I suspect maybe some of the reviewers who have had motherboard failures and such might be the victims of bad USB-C cables. I've read articles about how a bad USB-C cable can fry a device.<br><br>I saw a spreadsheet a while back, put together by an engineer working for Google, reviewing reliable cables. I think he had a very expensive tablet or phone get fried by a generic, and that was his inspiration for doing the reviews. It's been a while, but I remember it said that Anker, Amazon Basics, and the big name manufacturers like Apple, Google, Samsung, etc, were reliable and wouldn't damage a phone. Personally I won't trust anything else.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Opened up the box and was really afraid of what I might see, being that this is my first refurbished phone, and to my surprise, it looks like new!!! Yeah, this is just a just got it review but I am totally impressed. We set it up and had no problems whatsoever! Will update review after having for a bit longer. Hopefully it works as good as it looks.<br><br>So far so good though (hahaha it's only been here less than an hour.)<br><br>Update, reduced it to one star, wish I could give it zero. The phone just stopped working after a little over 2 months, don't waste your money. Nothing happened to it, it just stopped working, I even had a LifeProof case on it and it just wouldn't turn on anymore. See picture attached. That's all I would get, looks like a previous damage to the phone. Waste of time and money.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Received phone, no signs  use, looks brand new. Works perfectly well.

Mine came with a basic black wall charger, and a 3ft black type C charger. Dongle not included.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  So I just got this today, I was expecting to get it next week but it arrived early so that's good. I'd say this phone is awsome! I was surprised with the weight,its pretty light and getting a phone case soon. I love the resolution of this phone its great and the camera  is beyond my expectations, its great, speakers of this phone has really great quality. The only problem i have is that they gave me an LG charger instead of the actual google pixel charger. and phone wasn't charged up when i first opened it, but the good part was it charged halfway already for not even an hour. Down side for this phone, no headphone jack. But i didn't mind that because I have wireless headphones and wireless ear buds, so if you don't like not having a headphone jack, don't get this phone then.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I had this phone for a whopping 3 months and now it’s completely useless. It came with malware on it and I had to factory reset it at least 6 times in order to be able to use it at all. And now it’s totally locked and won’t let me back in. For $200+ that’s an expensive loss for me to only be able to use it for a few months. Plus my personal info was hacked so that’s not cool at all either. Do not buy!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  First and foremost, I have to mention that even though this was refurbished, it feels like totally new.  There are a few blips here and there such as the loading circle on YouTube videos being wack when on power saving mode, but this is the biggest complaint I can come up with.  Wow, the pixel 2 is really something.  I have been debating on what kind of phone to replace my Galaxy S4 (yes I know that's super old but I got it two years ago and it was practically new and totally free).  I am so glad I went with this phone.  I find myself using the squeeze to activate the assistant all the time.  I'm not much of a picture taker but the photos are amazing and make me want to finally use social media other than Facebook.  I think most of all I enjoy the total integration with Google.  It feels fast and simple, yet gives you the option to customize even the most insignificant of details, like what Google does when you tell it you just got home from work.  5 stars for sure, I absolutely adore this phone and highly suggest getting it!\n</span>""]"

Feels like brand new; you can't even tell it's refurbished. It's unlocked and mine is working with Metro PCS.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I was a little hesitant to order from this seller, but I decided to trust the reviews and go for it. Overall, I do like the phone and I think it works very well for what I paid for it. I took off one star because the packaging was an absolute joke and I had to stand there and blink a few times in shock over the fact that this is how they are going to send me a product that I paid them over almost $300 for. I wanted to take off another one but since the phone ended up not getting damaged from that ( I hope ) I didn't think it was fair.<br> For starters, the phone itself works perfectly. I haven't had any issues with it so far, aside from a slight delay when I tap on things, but I can just deal with that since it is only a second or two before it responds. This is only my first day using it though, so we will see. It works well enough with T-Mobile, which is my carrier. Though I have noticed it has a more difficult time getting decent service than my last phone, which was a very worn in and well loved Galaxy S7 that I had also bought refurbished and unlocked from amazon about three years after it came out. The internet connection is much slower on this phone compared to my other one, which is pretty annoying for me considering it is supposed to be newer and nicer. I'm not sure why an older and pretty beat up Galaxy S7 that was already three years old and refurbished to begin with would have faster internet connection than a supposedly refurbished S9.<br>There was VERY minimal wear. The only thing I noticed was a VERY small chip on the top rim of the phone. I don't even notice it unless I look for it closely. There was also some tiny fibers and some grit stuck around the rim of the camera, but I easily got them out by using my thumbnail. The fingerprint scanner works excellently, and the camera quality is perfect. The battery life is also great. It's ALMOST like a new phone.<br><br>Now about the way it was packaged. It came in an unsealed, unsecured slip of bubble wrap and placed in a box that was much larger the the phone itself with nothing to hold it still or stop it from jostling around and possibly breaking. The charger and sim card ejector tool were also tossed in unwrapped and unsecured and left to tumble around loosely with the phone. I'm hoping the delayed touch and slow internet connection isn't a result of the phone being tossed around. I definitely think the seller will have to fix that. I would NOT have been happy to have given them that much for a broken phone due to lazy packaging. I will upload pictures.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The phone is okay, but we got my mother the same phone and her display and icons are different than the ones on this phone. It says my version is up-to-date, so I'm not sure why there's a difference.<br><br>One problem with this phone is that it is not allowing me to send a message to more than one person at a time. I have gone to all the instructions online and tried everything that was suggested with no luck. I keep getting an invalid address error message. The phone my mom has, the same phone in theory, allows her to do this with no problem.<br><br>The second big problem is that I have to charge it every day because the battery drains like nobody's business. With my old phone, I charged it once a week, so having to charge it every day is pretty annoying.<br><br>I'm past the point of returning it because I dallied getting my new phone account set up, but I'm going to buy a different phone from a different vendor. Very disappointed in this one. :(\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I was wanted a new galaxy s9, after shopping around I realized fresh out of the box brand new was too pricey for me. So I decided to look on amazon for refurbished.<br>This is my first time buying any refurbished product and I have to say I'm amazed! It looks, sounds, and operates like brand new! There were no scratches or issues.<br>It was an easy 1,2,3 to activate this phone. I have metro PCS.<br>I would also like to add I was a previous iPhone user. It takes some getting used to initially and you need to set your preferences. In the end it works amazing! I will buy my next phone from this seller!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I had a lot of luck the last time I bought a refurbished phone on Amazon for the S7, so I decided to pull the trigger on another one now for the S9. It's a great little phone! Only issues was one scratch near where you plug in a charger, but there was even still original plastic covering on the edges at the top and sides. I put in my Verizon sim card and had it working in minutes. My last phone was on the fritz with tons of error messages so I'm glad this actually came earlier than expected. Originally it said it would take until Monday but it actually came in the normal prime window and arrived on Friday. Only issue is the charger. It's definitely not a Samsung, which I expected, but it charges so slowly that sometimes the phone says it is charging slower than the battery will deplete. But that's easy and cheap to replace. I was buying the phone not the charger, so I don't mind that much.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone came in perfect condition however after using it for about a month out of nowhere is stopped working with my cell phone provider when I went to Metro PC to see as to why they advised me that the phone has either been blacklisted by carrier or the previous may have reported it lost or stolen\n</span>', '<span>\n  This phone was supposed to be fully unlocked as this was a present for my sister.

Great phone but if it is advertised to be fully unlocked then it should be. I had purchased a refurbished phone from Apple a few years ago and it worked perfectly but this isn’t Apple. So I purchased the warranty.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone came in perfect condition. It came with a Samsung charger, but not the right one for this phone model, haha (the charger is for old Android devices).

All functions work and I\'m overall pleased with the phone so I\'ll give the PHONE 5 stars.<br>  Overall, ...4 stars since the seller claims these are ""unlocked by Samsung"", yet whenever I power the phone on, I get a ""SPRINT OMADM Activation not completed"" message.  I can \'swipe\' it away and go about using the phone as normal, but this should not be and is not at all expected for a phone that is claimed to be unlocked by Samsung.<br>  I would love to hear back from the seller regarding this error message as to how it can be removed, since I have yet to find how...\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I was worried about this purchase based on some of the reviews I've seen. A lot of bad renewal purchases are because multiple renewal shops share one Amazon page. So its a luck of the draw which one you get. Thanfully mine was awesome.<br><br>The phone was truly unlocked and I was able to move my SIM over no problem. The battery life is MUCH better than my old S6, even if it may be reduced from previous use. They even included a screen protector on it. All in all I'm very happy with the order.<br><br>To those who are worried, you just have to take the leap. If its not what you ordered, contact the seller. If that don't work contact Amazon.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I'm still trying to learn this phone. I have upgraded from A<br>S6. It's completely different. It literally is learning a new phone. All update this as I've had more time to spend with it. However, I must say that the speaker phone is excellent. Both ways<br>Okay, I have reduced my rating from a for two or three. It came with no SIM card. Nor just have a memory card of 128gb which was promised in the ad. I sent an email to the company requesting these items and this was 5 days ago. Obviously I have not received a response. As far as the phone goes it seems to be perfect. But you just don't get what you pay for. I knew that deal was too good to be true\n</span>"", '<span>\n  After reading some of the reviews here, I was a little concerned but went for it anyway since I could get the phone for half price. Phone came in a plain white box with a, SIM poker clip, generic charging cable, and outlet plug with USB port.  Nothing else.  Phone looks absolutely perfect.  Swapped SIM card out from my old Verizon Icon and was up and running in a few minutes.  Phone works perfect.  I saved about $380 by foregoing a fancy box and a bunch of paperwork no one ever reads.  You can find all the manuals online with a quick search.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was looking to spend less than retail for a new phone and decided to take a chance on Amazon Renewed. I looked around for a time to find a factory unlocked version of the Samsung Galaxy S10e.  Chubbiestech sent me a phone that was as brand new. Not a scratch or blemish on the unit I received. In the box was the phone with a screen cover printed with TXTNG &amp; DRIVING...IT CAN WAIT. OK, not usable as screen protector, but good message. It also included an aftermarket travel charging brick and USB cord. Also inside was the pin to open SIM socket. Battery charges to 100%. I would gladly buy from Chubbiestech again based on this purchase.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I received my phone within the time estimated for shipping. It was in a small aftermarket box, had some stickers with terrible handwriting on it, but it worked great! I was able to do a factory reset and full analysis. It was an activated unlocked T-Mobile phone, and I couldn't be happier. Everything works great on it, processor is snappy, screen is responsive, the fingerprint scanner can be finicky but I can always get it to work eventually. Good cell reception and stable wifi connection. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a smaller phone without skimping on internal hardware.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was leery because this was my first renewed phone purchase. This is only my second day of having the phone but so far so good. Phone had no scratches and connected successfully with Straight Talk. It sure was nice to save $300 by going renewed vs new.\n</span>', '<span>\n  My phone came from Tech Exchangee. The phone arrived FEDEX a couple of days before promised.<br>This is a true factory unlocked phone. I use Straight Talk as my carrier. I put in my Straight Talk GSM micro SIM card from my old Galaxy S8, and the phone setup was seemless - no problems at all.<br>The phone does have the Qualcom Snapdragon 855 processor. The battery life is excellent on this phone. The phone came with an aftermarket wall charger and a short charging cord. The ""pin"" to release the SIM card was not there, but the end of a small to medium wire paperclip works just fine. I used the Samsung Smart Switch app to transfer my pics, documents, contacts, and apps, from my old S8 to this S10E, and that worked perfectly.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Overall, it\'s a very good phone. I upgraded from an old S6 and I\'m enjoying the increased speed and battery life. The fingerprint reader on the side is lightning fast. I still have to learn a bit more about how to best utilize the features.<br><br>The vendor was terrific. It arrived right on time (or maybe early - I don\'t recall), even though the packaging was generic - the phone seemed brand new. One disappointment was that the charger was an off brand. I contacted the vendor and they explained that renewed items don\'t necessarily come with original chargers. But they told me they would send me a Samsung brand and I got it in a day or two! Great customer service.<br><br>My biggest complaint is that even though it was listed as Verizon compatible, some features don\'t work. I contacted Verizon to have them help me troubleshoot why I couldn\'t listen to voicemail messages without having to place a call. After two or three reps the top tier rep told me that it\'s because it\'s not a ""Verizon"" phone. There are a couple of other features that may not be available, but that\'s the one that bugs me the most. This was the first time I bought a phone from anyone other than an authorized Verizon dealer, so that may just be standard.<br><br>Bottom line? Excellent vendor and a very good phone.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Update:<br>Seller communicated well with me and issued a speedy exchange. Both phones worked flawlessly and appeared new.<br><br>Both came shipped in plain brown box with generic fast iq wall charger and sim key tool but the charge cord on the second one seems damaged. Not too big of a deal though, I'm happy in the end. :)<br><br>[Original: The phone is a factory unlocked one I think but it is locked to at&amp;t at the moment with an unpaid bill... you cannot even access the previous owners account to pay the bill if you wanted to, so the phone is essentially useless. I thought these phone were tested by professionals...]\n</span>""]"

However, I find the camera difficult to operate and, more importantly, the images it takes are of middling quality with low resolution, especially for landscapes and more distant objects and buildings.  Don't even think of using the zoom feature--the resulting photos are so grainy that they are basically unusable, which is probably a result of Google's decision to use a digital zoom rather than an optical one.  Among other defects are the erratic nature of the finger unlock feature (I now use only the PIN for that purpose) and the difficulty of activating Google Assistant.

This phone is either stolen or locked to another network!! I have waited all this time for a phone I can't even use! This seller (eMonkey) should not be able to get away with this fraudulent activity and needs to make it right!<br><br>Update: I have now received confirmation from Google Support that this phone is LOCKED TO VERIZON.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Im not going to review the phone-- use Toms List, etc to decide if this is the right phone for you.  My rating is for the product and the seller.  I ordered from the havEarly (Haverly Store), and the product received was legit original unopened deadstock.  All the accessories where there, and it was clearly never turned on or opened.  Its unlocked at least for ATT and TMobile.  Those are the two sims I have.  Also, it was a lot cheaper to get ""not pink"" color.  Everyone who looks at it literally goes ""its not pink,""  so if saving $ is your plan, I would highly recommend the discounted color.  With a case you can\'t even see it.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I have no need for the latest and greatest phone. When I do upgrade, I usually go for a flagship device a generation or two behind once they are reasonably affordable. I couldn't resist the great price for a new, unlocked Pixel 3 in Not Pink, not realizing I was wading into a unique technical issue between the Pixel 3 series and Sprint.  Tl;dr: be aware you are likely to encounter problems activating this device if you use Sprint or another Sprint-based carrier, and let me be clear it's not the device's (or the seller's) fault.  It will be stupidly inconvenient (particularly if you are using a Sprint-reselling carrier and are not an actual Sprint customer) to get this device activated as Sprint probably won't have the MEID on file and will fight you with a million excuses when you ask to have it added to their database. Long version: This model of Pixel 3 is quite apparently the only one out of the whole 3 series that will activate on Sprint at all, albeit with complications.  I was blissfully unaware of this carrier weirdness until I received my device, which arrived sealed and in perfect condition, went through the prompts to transfer my data, installed my SIM card and excitedly tried to activate it.  I kept getting errors while doing online self-activation, and even the agent with my carrier (a small pay-as-you-go provider on the Sprint network) couldn't activate it remotely.  He suggested that I contact Sprint directly, as the MEID did not seem to be eligible for activation. I called both Sprint and Verizon, both CDMA carriers, to see what information I could get about my device. Verizon: no MEID problem at all. If I were a customer they would have activated it on the spot. Might I mention, extremely polite, friendly and helpful. In contrast, phone calls to Sprint were rage-inducing. The MEID for my device was not found in Sprint's database as if the phone never existed, but they didn't want to help me add it since I'm technically not a Sprint customer even though my carrier licenses the use of their network. I cannot avoid the indirect relationship I have with Sprint, and the missing MEID was 100% their fault. All they had to do was start a support ticket to add the MEID to their database so I could activate my device after a waiting period, and they just wouldn't do it. Without a Sprint account, several tech support agents refused to help me with adding the MEID, despite my research showing the activation problem (and simple solution) Sprint has with Pixel 3 phones is clearly a known issue with a step-by-step resolution on Sprint's own tech support forum. I was stupified by their lack of action. After hitting a wall with Sprint's rude, unhelpful offshore telephone agents, I finally took the device to a physical Sprint store where at last I found someone helpful who made some phone calls of his own. People on the other side of the phone still insisted they would not help me without a Sprint account, and just when it was looking like I was going to have to wipe this device of my freshly transferred data and send it back, he typed in the MEID one more time just to be sure.  And there it was: my MEID was magically eligible for activation! So someone, somewhere, somehow did something despite their repeated refusals. Thereafter, I went home and effortlessly activated my device on my carrier with no further issues, as it should have happened in the first place. The phone has been great ever since.  I feel sorry for anyone stuck with Sprint, directly or indirectly, who likes this phone, but I am proof that it can be done.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Definitely used, but the slight wear on the screen doesn't effect the image or ability.

Takes awhile to charge fully but the battery lasts pretty long. 9 hours using Bluetooth headphones intermittently drained me to about 45%, wasnt actively using the screen but was texting on my work breaks and had 3/4 apps open(music, web, msg, and Snapchat)\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  After reading the comments, I was sooo nervous about this phone.

So I order one what I thought was a PIXEL 2. But today when I went to purchase a case to my surprise I HAVE A PIXEL XL!!!! I am so disappointed I paid $583 for a older model PIXEL!!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I personally like this phone! Its wonderful to handle, it takes some really good photo's and easy to use. But sadly the very first day I got it I was having battery issues. It charged pretty quickly but the battery life was terrible and I had to keep charging it constantly. For a while I didn't mind it, but when traveling with the phone, the battery life would drain after ever little use, especially when I used the google gps map. Im a pretty basic person and I didn't have that many apps at all. Only thing I had was facebook, and everything else was the google phone's systems.<br>Not only that but after having it for about a month, the phone started to mess up and it began shutting off when ever I attach the charger...It wasn't charging and I was really upset at that point. So I did sent it back and I am hoping to get a more better one. If the same thing happens, I just won't get the google pixel and will settle for something else sadly.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Not up to Amazon refurbished standards from the past when I got a phone that was in perfect condition and had over 90% battery life.<br>This phone had a visible scratched screen. You can see the scratch mostly when looking at photos but when web surfing you can't see it.<br>Also unacceptable 75% battery life.<br>There are better and cheaper options available, that have pictures of the phone so you know what you're buying before you get it, from other online stores.<br>The main reason to get it from Amazon is the 90-day return warranty.<br>Other reviewers have mentioned that the phone died after 6 months to a year, well that's not Amazon's fault after the 90-day warranty.<br>Also the pixel 2 has a two-year warranty. So if you find a seller that will work with you on that then you will still have six months to a year left on the two year warranty.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  This is a great phone! My last phone was an LG at the same price point and this one is wayyy better in so many ways. The camera is amazing, functionality is fantastic, and it's exactly as advertised. I wanted to give a review some time, so after a few months of use I can say it was an awesome purchase. Highly recommend if you're in the market for an affordable but awesome phone.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Excellent Deal. Battery life is a little on the short side, but keep a charger near and it's not too big a deal.<br><br>I had none of the problems that I've seen in other reviews. Got it activated with Verizon with no problems. The only indicator that it is a refurb is a few scratches on the back and edges. No damage to the screen. Nothing a case doesn't cover. Excellent value for the money.<br><br>The pixel 2 is by far the nicest phone I've owned. Love the camera and the operating system is clean and fast. Only complaint about the phone design is that there is no option for an SD card as Google expects you to back everything up on Google drive.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I got a Verizon bootloader locked Google Pixel 2. Finger print reader didn't work MOST of the time. I had to add 4 fingerprints of each finger I used for it to work at all. If I used apps like WhatsApp for video calling if the battery got down to 15% the phone screen would turn black with multicolored lines through it and shut off. I'm assuming the battery was bad and that's what caused it? It also got very hot when using it for video calls as well. And actually, the battery wouldn't hold a charge at all. I'd constantly find myself grabbing a cable and plugging it in every so often throughout the day because it was nearly dead. It would turn back on after pressing the power button. I returned the phone for a refund.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  When we received the phone it looked practically new. Everything came with it. I would LOVE to give it a positive review.<br><br>Here's the catch, it's a PHONE. I can't make or receive call audio on it though. It doesn't serve the function that is literally the requirement of a phone.<br><br>I have called customer service and am currently waiting for a response.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Good, adequate smartphone for those of us that don't need all the latest gadgets. The unlocked version worked with Verizon just fine. It uses a mini-sim port, so you'll need one of those from your carrier.  Refurbished and used are just fine.<br><br>The battery life is medium, but could go a day or two on one charge with medium use, using maps in the morning, surfing web during lunch, and many texts through the day. I rarely use it for games. I turned off the squeeze feature as that got annoying after some use. I also turned off the annoying Google news features.<br><br>The phone size is about as large as I will ever go for a smart phone, but in the future I will probably look for something smaller. The size of this phone is just a tad over the mid-range iPhones. Overall, i prefer Android as to not get stuck in the Apple price gouging, but Google has is drawbacks as well. For me, it works, but I can fiddle with it when I want. This has been a good replacement for my Samsung 5.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Overall very satisfied with this product. I purchased from Tech Exchangee and the phone looks brand new. No scratches/dings. Screen is perfect. Phone works great. Came with charger and a little screen film. My only complaint is the battery life. I think it works pretty well and from what I understand, the pixel 2 just doesn't have a great battery life. I'd say my use is heavy-ish and by noon it's almost dead. It does recharge really fast though. But if you're looking for a long lasting phone, this is not it.<br>Otherwise, great deal, great phone, great camera.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This is an excellent budget phone option in 2020 if you can get it for a reasonable price. Just make sure you familiarize yourself with Google\'s update scheduling before spending too much on a used Pixel. I bought mine ""renewed"" from an Amazon seller and the screen is immaculate with only minor wear to the area surrounding the USB C port. Also, the battery seems to have plenty of life left in it. Additionally, I really like how no network branding is displayed on the startup screens.\n</span>']"

I've been using Motorola phones for years, so I debated on whether or not to buy a Samsung phone after reading terrible reviews of their OS 'tweaks'.  I updated the phone from Oreo to Pie right after I got it using the standard update process and in doing so, also got an upgrade from Samsung's 'Experience' to 'One UI' and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I do miss the way Motorola's standby screen automatically displays notifications without needing to touch the phone, but other than that, I've been pleasantly suprised with One UI.\n</span>""]"

No questions asked, no tricky stipulations. Just make sure you keep all your original materials and stay within the 90 days. The next phone I bought seems to be perfect, other than it isn’t that cheerful red. I did subtract one star because I think it could have been more thoroughly checked out prior to sale.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I bought this phone to replace a cheap Galaxy J3V which ran out of storage space after a few videos (16 gig vs 256 gig).  I saw the Iphone had a different size SIM than the Galaxy so I ordered a new SIM from Verizon at no cost and got it one day after I got the phone.  I charged the Iphone for several hours and started the activation.  Wouldn't activate and I talked to 4 or 5 Verizon people over two days (and long waits for a tech).  The last guy said he could see the phone and the SIM on his system but there must be something wrong with the phone, so I sent it back and said I would try another (the people at KISS were nice and got me a different phone).  Both phones were in excellent shape and the second one had a nice screen protector already installed.  Guess what?  Still wouldn't activate.  After over an hour wait on Dec 26, the Verizon tech said I needed to get a strong signal from a tower instead of a wifi signal.  This immediately made sense to me (why didn't the other Verizon techs figure this out?)  After a seven mile trip to a parking lot near a tower, the phone activated in about 15 seconds.  Amazing, right?  Not exactly.  I got back home and couldn't do anything over wifi.  The next morning I got to speak to a tech  right away but no solution.  The next level tech told me he also lived outside of cell area and used wifi and knew the problem.  Guess what, I had to go back to the tower to get a strong LTE signal to activate wifi.  The phone works fine now and I'm very happy with it.  KISS gets good marks and Verizon needs to know some people don't have cell service at their home.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I’ve bem using it for 2 weeks and it looks perfect.

Did you know that the Japanese model doesn't allow the user to silence the shutter sound effect when taking pictures, or the beeps when starting or stopping video recording?  After some embarrassment in front of clients at job site surveys, I researched the model number and learned why it was happening.  I ended up downloading a non-Apple camera app, in order to avoid the sound effects.  If I was sent the A1863 model as listed, this issue would not have cropped up.  That is why I am taking off one star from this review.<br><br>To the seller's credit, the phone arrived a day early, was packaged well, and was in excellent physical shape.  All I had to do was put my SIM card in it, and load in everything from my iTunes account.

Still a good value for me.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  There are several people on here that wrote reviews saying the phone didn't work on Verizon, broke shortly after, etc.  It certainly made me pause before purchasing, but I really needed a replacement phone for my son and wasn't going to pay top dollar for a new phone again.<br><br>I ordered the phone on a Tuesday, and was surprised when the FedEx box showed up on Thursday (a full 4 days earlier than estimated).  Next, the packaging was decent and included a genuine charger plug and cable.  Finally, the phone looked absolutely brand new.  Not a touch or smudge anywhere.  I immediately took it to the Verizon store, and they got it registered on the network within 5 minutes.<br><br>I know there are other reviews that had similar experiences as mine, but you always think that you are going to be the one that gets the dud that doesn't work.  It would seem like it's a good company though and perhaps they'd swap it out if you happen to be unlucky (I can imagine it has to occasionally happen - it is a used phone after all, each with a different history).  Apparently I got one from a grandma that didn't take it out of the box. :)<br><br>Overall, very happy.  Hopefully you will be just as fortunate.

However, if I understand it correctly, refurbished items are usually items that are returned under warranty for whatever reason, fixed, and then resold. Normally, they look like new. If we were to agree on that definition then calling these phones refurbished is probably a little bit of a stretch. I ordered two phones, and they were clearly used phones. They work fine but know that you are going to get an item that it is obviusly second hand. They don't even come in their original packaging with original accessories, another clue of their second hand origin.

Also, the 90day guarantee through Amazon for exchange/refund did not work as I thought it would - I preferred a exchange since I got a good deal but customer service said all I could get was a refund.

It also didn't come with a USB C splitter so I can charge and listen to music at the same time (I heard new phones do include this.) All it came with was the phone and a charger.

I am sooooo glad I made the switch.<br>The battery life is wonderful. I go three to four days without recharging.<br>I also learned there is a Samsung Switch app that makes transferring all your phone numbers and other data from old phone to new one.<br>In the process of activating service on the new phones, I switched from Tracfone to Consumer Cellular. Cost a couple bucks more a month, but very happy with the service.<br>Also, the Consumer Cellular customer service person who helped with the switch commented that he has heard many customers are very happy with the Galaxy S10 phone.<br>Also, footnote about Consumer Cellular: They are apparently based in Arizona and their customer service people speak good English, unlike the damned Tracfone customer service people.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I had heard and read horror stories about buying refurbished, that they would not work, scratched up, owe money to a carrier and cannot be activated, etc.<br>I received this phone a day early and about 50% of the sale price for a new one. It came in a non Samsung packaging with aftermarket charger and nothing else. But who cares, I have a zillion fast chargers and cables laying around already.<br>Here is what is important, it looked perfect, just like new, and when I put my Cricket SIM in it worked just like advertised.<br>Here is the review on the phone - still the first day, but the online Samsung and galaxy smart switch app worked great as usual, 5 minutes to set up and 15 to download and everything is back in place, app tiles are exactly the same and all my texts and photos transferred over (I downloaded to storage and deleted from the old phone most of my pics first to save time.<br>I received this phone from tech exchangee; I guess there are several it can come from.<br><br>Good luck\n</span>', '<span>\n  I really like this phone.<br><br>However, I have one main complaint about it, which is that it doesn\'t have an openable case and removable battery. I\'ve replaced the battery on 2 out of the last 4 android phones I\'ve owned, and I tend to do so on the more expensive phones. This would be one of the more expensive phones I\'ve owned, so I\'m probably going to own in long enough that that\'s an issue, and it\'s annoying that not only this model doesn\'t have a removable battery, but that none of the recent Samsung models other than the XCover series (which don\'t work on my carrier, T-mobile) offer such a feature. Shame on Samsung and T-mobile for failing to deliver a feature that I most want, especially on a high-end phone that I tend to want to own for 4+ years.<br><br>Another minor complaint, which is sort of related to the phone because it\'s Samsung, is that the Samsung ""Smart Switch"" app failed repeatedly when trying to transfer messages from my old phone, and I wasted a couple of hours in my life in the process and finally gave up at transferring all my messages. For a phone of such high hardware specs (8-core processor, lots of RAM) there is no technical reason for it to struggle so much, being so slow and failing multiple times, at transferring a relatively small amount of data (~2GB, 100K messages.)<br><br>Besides that, I have few complaints about the phone. The hardware is great, processor is fast, camera works great, battery life is good, and it\'s quite small and compact yet they\'ve somehow managed to make the display a bit larger by eliminating more of the unused space at the screen margins. I also like the location of the power and volume buttons. I could do without Bixby and some of the more invasive modern features, but again this is a complaint about the smartphone industry as a whole, pretty much all the companies are doing awful stuff like that.<br><br>Compared to other phones this is a good model.<br><br>And I\'m glad I bought a ""renewed"" refurbished one. It arrived like-new and has worked flawlessly, and saved me well over 1/3rd the cost of a new phone.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Overall phone is excellent. At first I had a lil trouble with it being quite warm during normal use, with touch sensitivity and with notification panel not being able to be pulled down. Did some research on google and was able to find a work-around for the notification panel and touch sensitivity. And also found solution for the warm-ness. No problem with that since.  Later my phone updated (twice) and then the notification panel issue was fixed. I have no idea which processor I have but I dnt think that kind of stuff will bother me. Touch sensitivity is still not GREAT but it's not nearly as bad. Overall , very happy and satisfied I was FINALLY able to get the phone I wanted (and pay for it outright). I've been waiting and searching all over since the release last year.<br>4 stars just bc of the few issues I initially had.<br><br>*update 7/2<br>Tried to take a few pics-front camera is good, no issues. However,  the rear camera is blurry/fuzzy and has sort of a haze. I have cleaned it and also tried different settings, nothing works. (Maybe that's why the previous owner let it go...)Now I'm getting disappointed. This phone has a great camera and now I can't really use it. I have already activated service on this phone so sending it back for a replacement would be a headache. Will contact customer service.<br>Bumped down to 3 stars.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Guys idk why people have one star reviews, Amazon has a 90 DAY WARRANTY for Renewed products, so return it and ask for a proper device or money back.<br><br>Thankfully I have never had issues with Renewed Products on Amazon so this one came in it's own renewed box with a USB-C charger and 5watt brick.<br><br>I came with all the proper information listed and was fully unlocked.<br><br>Also the phone was top notch since I'm somewhat of a tech enthusiast I went through the phone hardware checks through specific codes and found ZERO hardware or software issues, as completely good as brand new for half the price.<br><br>Lastly, I have to say that Amazon's Renewed Phone Warranty and prices are just better than the USED market, New Market, and any OTHER market, because for me personally it's 0% risk (As if it's locked or blacklisted I just return the phone and ask for a replacement).<br><br>Don't worry about renewed phones they are GREAT!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I am not really a 'gadget guy' so I won't really go into much detail about the phone itself, but I will say that it was a worthwhile step up from my 4-year-old Galaxy S6.  It is much faster, has better battery life, and the fingerprint sensor and facial recognition make it easier to use.  The facial recognition seems very solid - the fingerprint sensor does too but occasionally takes 2 or 3 tries.<br><br>Really just wanted to write a review with regard to it being an Amazon Renewed phone.  There seems to be mixed reviews here which I am guessing is based on differences between the actual seller.  Mine was from RE-CELL, and the experience was positive.  The phone looks brand new.  I have only had it for about a week but have not had any issues so far.  It was easy to activate (basically just plugged in my AT&amp;T SIM card), the charging cable and adapter work fine, and the battery life seems solid.  I am not a heavy user but I have been able to go pretty much a full 24 hours between charges.<br><br>I was a little hesitant after reading some of the negative reviews, but I am completely satisfied with the purchase and would recommend it to someone looking for a renewed/refurbished phone.  If anything maybe just pay attention to which seller it is, and if possible look for one from RE-CELL.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This Samsung Galaxy S10e is a blessing.  Face recognition and fingerprint recognition is very accurate.  Sound quality is awesome, reception in my home with wifi is supreme compared to other non samsung models tried previously.  Overall a great phone and the condition I received it in was as new in every aspect!<br>On the flipside: I wish it had its own separate abilities for different notification alerts.  I had to download Alertify to assist in know if my phone was telling me its a text, email or my security camera system at home.  That is a huge oversight on Samsung.  Alertify seems ok with meshing with this issue.  I also would have desired it a tad wider, just for text key purposes...otherwise, its a true Hero of cellphones.  David\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Finally a smaller, high quality android phone that will work on Verizon. So tired of the recent trend for huge slab phones that you cannot put in any women's clothing pocket.  This phone is attractive, feels good in the hand as well.  I find only 2 annoyances: 1)  simply reaching to pick up the phone almost always results in an accidental press of one or more of the edge buttons, thus inadvertently silencing, dismissing whatever alert prompted the attempt, or hanging up on incoming calls as I attempt to answer.  and 2) the default samsung keyboard that has talk to text ability, is really very bad. I think the developers have a dark sense of humor, and that the majority of those hilarious miss-typed text threads we see on the web, probably came from a samsung. While you can use the google keyboard which works much better, I have found no way to make that the default. So you have to actively open it and select it each time you wish to speak a text message, or enter a search.  Actually, even if you want to use the samsung keyboard you must actively select the one with the microphone each time. They need to update this to allow user to set the desired default keyboard. Not sure why any keyboard apps even exist that don't have a speak to type feature anymore. Yet that is the kind that this phone 'defaults' to in texts and searches. Over all though, a very good little phone and I am glad Samsung made this smaller phone.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Great phone and works as it should! It arrived on time and well packaged from the seller RE-CELL. My only complaint is that it\'s described as ""locked to AT&amp;T,"" however, the AT&amp;T Visual Voicemail app is not compatible. There is no AT&amp;T branding in the phone software/apps either. This makes me think it\'s not an AT&amp;T locked phone....Would have helped to know that, but not a total deal breaker.<br>I upgraded from a Galaxy S6 and this S10e is pretty much the same size but with more screen real estate! With my petite hands (and pockets), this size is so wonderful! Love that it has 128GB of storage with an option to expand it as well. The fingerprint reader on the power button works perfectly. The trick is finding a good case that doesn\'t block your fingers too much when using the reader. I also really love the sound quality from this little powerhouse! I use earbuds to listen to Amazon Music and the quality is SO clear and perfect. Call quality and speaker phone are excellent too! I\'ve also found that the battery life seems to be VERY good for a whole day of calls/texts/camera/streaming music/web surfing/apps. The phone does a great job of killing background apps when not in use so they don\'t drain the battery.<br>Love this phone!!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was looking for a powerful phone that would easily fit in my pocket. The other option for me was the Samsung Galaxy A40 but I wanted to be absolutely sure that I had all the latest bells and whistles plus support for Samsung\'s blockchain wallet (which it does support). The S10e also supports 5Ghz Wifi and that was a big selling point because I have so many neighbors all around my home and so the 2Ghz airwaves are pretty congested.  So many manufacturers are making phones with displays that I frankly think are too big to be practical for fitting in a pocket.  So with 6GB RAM &amp; 128GB Internal Storage plus expansion up to 512GB, this was the phone for me. No regrets here. One last thing, This phone came with Android 10 and has updates for security for 2 years. I am using it with Tracfone\'s ""Bring your own phone plan"" with the verizon-compatible SIM card (purchased separately). Got this as an Amazon Renewed Phone.\n</span>']"

Unable to rate the he face recognition or fingerprint reader cause I don't use them.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was disappointed in allot of things about this phone. The voice to text and swipe technology was much better on my 7. Not sure why it would go backward from the 7 to the 9, but voice to text is unusable. I use that when I am driving and stop at a stop light. At the next light I am correcting so much, I usually just toss it out and wait until I can type or Swype it in.  Swype has its issues too. Don\'t get near the space bar unless you intend to start a new word or want to be offered a multi word resolve. Simple words like ""the"" and ""in"" are almost always ""thr"" and ""iin"". Yes, the ""R"" is next to the ""E"", but after deleting thr and tjr and all the other offerings in the selection bar, I still continue to get those over a REAL word. I even see it auto correct the to thr, even though auto correct is not on. Can we see just a touch of intelligence?<br><br>Specifically on the refurb side, the battery was never good. I do use my phone allot, but it didn\'t make it through the day from the first day I purchased it. That is in fact why I purchased. My 7\'s battery was good for a couple of years. That was and is very disappointing. When I was considering a purchase, my decision was should I buy a battery pack for my existing phone or just buy a new phone. Now I am looking a battery packs for my new phone, plugging in every chance I get and hoping I make it to the next charge. Exactly where I was with my old phone.<br><br>I will say the screen technology is much better. I have the same protection cover manufacturer on this phone as I did on my 7. I dropped my 7 a few times and it broke a little in the corners each time. Not a screen crack, but surface splintering; separation of the layers of glass. I have dropped this one twice and it has had no effect. Maybe just lucky, but I think the screen technology is better.<br><br>I rated the facial recognition and fingerprint technology low because they work very poorly. I gave up on the fingerprint reader. Just too frustrating to use as it hardly ever works. The facial recognition is very poor as well. I am still using it, but am forced to insert my password at least fifty percent of the time. It seems it works well in very bright light, like if you are outside. In the house or with any restriction of light, you are going to be entering your password. To add insult to injury, occasionally I swipe the screen up to do facial recognition and move the phone back down to speak with someone and out of the corner of my eye I see it open. That makes me feel safe...<br><br>I have been a Samsung hero for a long time. I am definitely not a hero for this phone. I would not buy it again or any of the 9 series phones because of owning this one. Maybe its time to find something new and step up to buying another new phone and not a refurb.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I ordered this phone after having my S6 for 4 years.

Otherwise the phone is great! Great pictures sound speakerphone inbound outgoing calls. Its fast. I'm happy considering I expected much worse. HOWEVER  this was not a Verizon phone. T mobile showed up on startup. Soon as the sim card was installed and phone was updated upon startup it was Verizon start up screen. No issues on reception. Overall good. Not great cuz of battery and fingerprint but thats the only bad. No scratches dents screen is mint. Overall good buy if your not picky about small sh#$\n</span>""]"

For the record, the poor accessories, and missing tool are the reasons why I took off one star.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Worked directly with my verizon sim card with no issues, phone did not come in original box, did not come with headphones either.

Just gonna throw on a case and rock it.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I was hesitant to buy given the mixed reviews, but with Amazon return policy figured there was no financial risk.  The phone I received was in perfect condition, no visible scratches font, side, or back, has a clean IMEI number, and was unlocked.  No hiccups at all during setup. It came with an off-brand charger and cable.  The charger does not have sufficient amps to correctly charge the phone, but works fine for older devices (this is why I knocked off 1 star).  I have a feeling that experience is dependent on the Amazon partner who sends the phone.  Mine came from 'Tech Exchangee'.  Overall I am satisfied with the speed of delivery and condition of the phone.  I would buy again.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  This is a great phone. I switched from an lg v30 and the most glaring difference is the screen. The screen is not a high end OLED, so the color difference was slightly jarring. Generally just not as vivid. And the holepunch front camera doesnt get in the way either. Other than that it is better than the v30, although pricier today.<br>  The problem is with the seller. This is labeled as unlocked and i recieved a verizon phone. Wasn't an issue for me as i use verizon, but this is plain incompetent. And a minor complaint but not a glaring issue is that there was a scuff on the screen upon recieving the phone. Its not super noticeable but discolors when a bright color is displayed behind it.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The phone itself was perfectly fine.  There were no visible scratches when I got it.  The fingerprint reader is fine as well, in a bit of a strange position, but fine.  The primary reason for my rating is the charger I received.  While it was the correct charger for the phone, the part that plugs into the phone was too... short?  It won't stay in the phone, and the phone won't recognize it's there.  You'll have to buy a separate charger.  When quick charging, the phone charges up in 2 hours.  When using the charger that was supplied (after I cut back the plastic that prevented it from working), the charge-up time was listed at 9 1/2 hours.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone itself is in perfect working condition not one blemish, beautiful phone.

The package arrived early so that's always appreciated. Everything is brand new and working great.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Love it great phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Lets start with the Phone. I DID receive the Galaxy A71 in Blue like I ordered in about a week so im happy with that. Everything performance wise is working fine right now, it does in fact feel like a original Samsung device. It works fast and quick as the specs shows it should. Both cameras do operate as intended. It comes with a case for the A71 and a screen protector installed with the side bezel plastic, Not sure if this is factory or aftermarket by ""JP Mobiles"". The outside of the Phone looks amazing, the blue back plastic looks very bright and has the rainbow affect it should when moved in light, looks great and authentic. The sound on mine works great. Flashlight works as should. Battery life is great so far aswell. I have been able to download all my social media apps and log in without issues. It also does have the GB storage that is advertised, so that it good. Now there are some weird things though to keep in mind, im ok with them so far as im satisfied with my Phone but you may not be. The A71 DID NOT come with the factory plastic wrap on the box. It also comes with a mainly Spanish writing box for a reason i\'ll get to. It also comes with a ""JP Mobiles"" shiny sticker to hold the box shut together because their is no plastic wrap. When I go into the ""status"" in the settings, the Manufacturer says ""DISENDO Y DESARROLLADO POR SAMSUNG"". I don\'t know what it means but cleary the Phone tends to be from SOUTH AMERICA and NOT NORTH AMERICA. Going on their Instagram they say their from Miami, Florida but on Amazon they say they Ship from Canada so that in confusing. There are many reviews of people saying they got a device in Spanish so take that into consideration. The sticker on the right side displaying what the Phone is such as colour/model also says ""New"" which to be honest, im not sure what to believe because it was opened at one point before me. Finally I will say personally from what ive been using on the Phone I am satisfied but you may not be with their business being so confusing. Spanish Phones but ""ships from Canada"" with a location link to ""Miami, Florida"". I don\'t know whats going on there. I gave 3 stars only because I don\'t know what to believe on where they and the Phone is actually from. The actual Phone itself that I received is great though. Hopefully this helped you in making the right choice for you and with any questions you had before buying.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I was really disappointed when I open the packaging to find that there was absolutely no plastic wrap on the box at all. It wasn't even the fact that the plastic wrap was broken and cut open it wasn't even there. All the accessories and everything were inside but the way the phone is acting now is telling me that this is actually a refurbished phone and not brand new. It keeps freezing every time I try to take a picture and it keeps freezing when I'm trying to use some of the apps. I'll tap on the screen and nothing will happen cuz it's frozen. I'm definitely going to be looking at returning this.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  EDIT: I got this phone as an alternative to the $1000+ phones that have all the features that should be standard by now. This phone has all the things top tier phones have that you want; good camera, large amoled screen, great screen to body ratio...ect.<br>1 month later though, the phone stopped working correctly. The bottom loud speaker stopped working, so no more ringer. Airplane mode stays stuck on unless the SIM Card is taken out and reinstalled and SAMSUNG DOES NOT WARRANT THE PHONE!<br>I think the issues may be caused by a Samsung software update, but Samsung doesn't care to help.<br>Would I buy this phone again? No. I would not.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Love this phone. I was very weary on ordering a phone from Amazon but I got my daughter the A20 last summer and it has been great so far.  This was more expensive but I did my research before purchase. It's cheaper than the actual Samsung website and more colors than whats available to Canada.<br><br>Overall this is a great phone. I replaced my Google Pixel 3XL for this A71 and it's been better so far. The battery is what I am impressed with I can have it on all day watching videos or browsing and it will last throughout the day, I've had to put it on a charger once whereas my previous phones had to be charged multiple times throughout the day.<br><br>When it arrived the box was sealed with a sticker and had everything included. Charger cable, Wall outlet, ear phones and the manuals and warranty info. It had a little box with a clear phone case. The phone itself has a screen protector already installed.<br><br>Overall I am very happy with this purchase.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  This is a fantastic phone. It has everything I wanted: excellent cameras, long-lasting battery, a gorgeous display, removable storage, and a ton of built-in storage as well. My one complaint is all the bloatware that came preinstalled, like Spotify, Facebook, OneDrive to name a few; but after I disabled whatever I couldn't uninstall, I used a third-party launcher (Apex) to hide the garbage apps, and everything is fine. The speaker is surprisingly good for what it is, and while there is no notification light, the A71 does have a customizable always on display. I'm also glad they kept the 3.5mm jack, because as outdated as that port is, it's nice to have redundancy in case Bluetooth fails or isn't an option. Great phone for the money.\n</span>""]"

Battery lasts a LOOOOOOOOONG time (at least 10 hours for me) and games run seamlessly. Call quality crystal clear. Phone uses a USB-C type charger, which is included in the package.<br>Phone comes with a proficiently placed tempered glass screen protector preinstalled, which was more than appreciated even though it sadly began to peel off as soon as I put my new Otterbox Defender on the device.

They went the extra mile by including it and that shows they genuinely care about customer satisfaction and product security.<br>Would have thought it was brand new and probably will go through this seller again for refurbed devices in the future.

But, I'll say this, when I ordered the phone, it took them two weeks before they authorized the purchase, and then when the phone came it was great except it said Sprint all over the opening sequences, and then I checked the camera going out, Physically the camera was intact, clean, and unbroken, as described in the description. However, when you went to take a photo of something 2 feet away and beyond, the camera was blurred, and there was no setting that was selected. So I called and the awesome agent named Kevin helped me out, reassured me that the phone was unlocked in light of the sprint logos. Then asked for the service I needed, and was able to get a new phone sent out, that was unlocked, but working in all the correct ways now, in a timely manner.

Check the camera, etc.)\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was really worried at first buying a phone on amazon but this came perfectly fine, one VERY minor knick on the top of the phone but doesn\'t affect anything at all, camera is beautiful, system works flawlessly with my Verizon sim card that i simply transferred from my old iphone to this phone. With the ""Smart Switch"" app and the adapter that the company sent with the phone I simply plugged the samsung phone into the same cord into the iphone and within maybe an hour all my information contacts and all were sent over to the samsung, it did take at least the rest of the day to catch up and load all my previous text messages and apps but everything was super smooth and phone is still useable while updating. The battery life is a little bit worse then the iphone but once I go through optimizing the battery life and which apps take up the most (like Pokemon Go), it works perfectly!!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I just learned that what I thought was a problem, was not. A rep from the seller called very quickly and gave me the info I lacked. I will return to finish the review after I get it set up and working. Everything looks excellent so far! The seller\'s customer service is stellar!<br>Update: I am returning the phone because one of my kids bough a phone for me for Xmas! I got it early (hee-hee) because I was going to have to get a new SIM card which meant a trip into civilization.<br>This phone looked new. Nice phone. I never got it set up, but from what I saw it looked in great working order. And again, thanks to the seller\'s great customer service! It was refreshing not being talked down to!

Prior to buying an iPhone 8 through this method I read through a bunch of reviews. I admit that I was a bit nervous about buying the “renewed” device. I took the chance and bought it. The device was in really good shape. These phones are all glass. There wasn’t a scratch on the thing. It is pristine. My own 8plus has been in cases the entire time I’ve owned it and it looks more worn than the 8 I purchased here. There are zero signs of wear on the lightning port . Battery was at 90% health. I updated it to iOS 13 (it had 12) The phone looks and runs as if it were brand new.  I can safely recommend this product and seller.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  To begin , my seller was Chubbiestech, the phone arrived two days early in the AmazonRenewed box, included was a charger, cord, screen protector, and sim tool. The phone itself was pristine, absolutely spotless. Zero scratches, dents, or marks. And it has 91% of it's battery capacity. the phone functions perfectly, it arrived in such a condition that i would have thought it was a brand new phone straight from the Apple store!. I had been reading some of the concerning negative reviews and decided to purchase this phone, i do not regret it one bit. i am very pleased.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  So, many negative reviews describe issues with phone, scratches, battery life, etc.<br><br>I took a risk as the price was decent for a newer mode 64 GB phone to upgrade my older 16 GB one.<br><br>Yes, mine came with a battery life of 87, but that was WAY better than my old iphone.<br><br>Came in a simple box with off brand but working charging block and wire, with SIM card push pin.<br><br>At the moment (about a week), I can say the phone looks and works AMAZING.<br><br>Looks brand new, works smooth, updated to iOS 14 with no issues.<br><br>The negative reviews here seem legit, but my experience was great, and for the price of &lt;$300, felt it was worth the risk and Amazon has a good return policy.<br><br>I am SUPER happy with purchase, and encourage people to weigh the risks, and order with plan to return if it isn’t ideal, but know that I LOVE my new phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was looking for an older model iPhone with a good amount of life left in it. Since the 8 isn’t sold new anywhere, this refurbished option seemed worth a try. Upon arrival the phone was unlocked and in great shape with only a few minor scrapes on the outside edge; battery life was at 88% of original. The only small problem I was having was that the response to touch on the screen was intermittent, something with which I could probably manage.<br><br>I decided to ask the seller about a replacement; once I started the return process (with a request for a replacement) the seller communicated very quickly and had a label for me to mail the old phone back that same day.<br><br>The replacement came in as quickly as the old went out. It had a more responsive touch screen and even better battery life. So far no other problems.<br><br>I am very happy with the used / renewed phone and even happier that the seller was so easy to work with. Thanks!<br><br>Seller was PDI Mobile.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Kanga Supply does not check their phones before shipping. Their phones are supposed to be ""fully unlocked"", but it came locked, because the previous owner did not remove his Apple ID. We couldn\'t proceed beyond the first prompt to choose a language. I communicated several times via email about the issue, but Kanga said that they couldn\'t solve the issue. I was advised to return it for a full refund, but now they are stating that the refund couldn\'t be processed because the phone is locked. They are accusing me of locking it. They seriously need to improve their screening system before they sell!  Please avoid Kanga if you are interested in purchasing a secondhand phone. It is beyond frustrating. I tried to call but they are not open on weekends and have limited hours during the week.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I almost returned it after I couldn’t get it to read my SIM card. But after multiple attempts, a tiny piece of metal fell out onto my lap and I attempted once more to insert my SIM card into the phone and it slid right in, where as before it must’ve been being blocked by that tiny piece of metal, and the compartment that holds the SIM card wasn’t being inserted all the way and was actually protruding out of the phone, but it wasn’t that noticeable until i compared it both mine and my sisters iPhone, and those were both flush with the phone. I’m extremely happy with my purchase after that issue was resolved. I ordered the silver case, its white on the back side not silver, but I still like it. With a case on all u can see is the silver Apple and I guess the white makes it stand out, otherwise it doesn’t seem like it would. The circle around the home button is silver though. This may be what they consider silver🤷🏻\u200d♀️. Regardless I’m happy with everything, works and looks like a brand new phone. If I have any issues I’ll update.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Pretty much like new. I was quite skeptical given its Amazon and one step removed from the Wild West but the device is just about like new. A strong battery, no scratches, everything functions well and it even came with a tempered glass screen protector. I’m very impressed with the Renewed program.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Exactly what I was hoping for. Great condition barely any scratches! Screen protector and case were included!!! What else could you ask for. I’d buy from this seller again.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  At first I thought I got scammed because the box it came in was just a generic smartphone box, which sounds fine at first, but the box had the details of a completely different phone so I was sweating a bit when I saw that. The phone was correct, though, and came in good condition. It wasn't perfect, as you'd expect from a refurbished phone; there was a tiny scuff in the metal on the upper right corner, but that doesn't bother me one bit since it's covered by my case. I think that $280 is a good price for a well-refurbished iPhone 8, since it also comes with the trust that it's in top renewed condition versus buying for less from FB marketplace or something like that. I also purchased the protection plan which covers drops, cracks, water damage, etc. and it is well worth it to me. After the initial $50 payment, paying $29 to have my phone repaired or $49 to have it replaced in the case of it breaking is a great deal of a protection plan to me.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I purchased this phone and my carrier, Cricket blocked my use of data and messages unless on wifi. When we called to figure out why, they had stated that the phone was blacklisted by AT&amp;T in January of 2019. Meaning, this phone was not meant to be sold to anyone. Very disappointed.\n</span>']"

The home button action has quite a different feel from the iPhone 6/7 button.  It takes a bit of getting used to.

The touch screen sensitivity was not diminished at all. Screen was super clear. My grown daughters were resistant to use any new brand.

It was advertised as battery exceed 80% (This product will have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new) but it was exactly at 80% which means I have to replace a new battery eventually which costs another $80-$100. The screen freezes off a lot of time and one one point, only the home button works. I have to do hard reset to make it coming back to usual. Trying to call customer services but no one available, emailing them is no help. I regret to buy this. Now I have to take time to return plus I need to find a different one in 2 days. Horrible experience\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I was a bit hesitant with this purchase because of the mixed reviews but I ended up buying it . It came in just today and works perfectly fine. The phone came without any scratches and without any trouble connected with Cricket easily . I ordered the phone full unlocked and based on others reviews was a bit scared of getting it with another company or getting it not unlocked. The phone came in with a charger but no headphones. You'll have to use your own tool when it's time to remove the sim card. Overall for right now the phone works fine but will update the review if any problems come in the few days.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I've been an iPhone user for the past 13 years, and while I love the interface and design, I do not like paying the high price for a new phone. Last month, after dropping my iPhone 6 (I know I'm very behind on the models, but it still worked well!), I made the decision to upgrade. I love that I can use Amazon Renewed to find a iPhone at a fraction of the price of a new one.<br><br>Many of the reviews made me nervous about making this investment because the phones they received had some problems. Since the seller Hybrid IT had great reviews, I felt better about taking the risk. (To be noted, I initially bought a iPhone 6S from Hybrid IT, but then returned it after deciding to upgrade to an iPhone 8. The return was easy and the seller was helpful!)<br><br>The phone I received was in great condition, and I had no trouble setting it up with my AT&amp;T SIM card. I've been using it for the last three weeks, and I haven't run into any issues.<br><br>There are a few things to add, the phone came with a generic charging cord with a wall plug-in. It did not come with headphones, so if you are buying an iPhone 8, you'll have to buy Bluetooth headphones or Earpods with the lightning connector, which are about $29 on the Apple site. Finally, the battery health is at 84% according to my phone, which is expected with a refurbished phone. It does last me through the day, but something to note if you are in the market. I hope this helps!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I upgraded from an Iphone 6s to an Iphone 8. I had been looking around and saw this refurbished one on Amazon for $248 and decided to take a chance on it. I also had $40 of credits to use. I figured it's backed by Amazon with their 90 day warranty too. I don't play games or watch movies or any of those things so I didn't need to get the newest Iphone that's out there. My old one had 16GB this one has 64, so I'm getting 3 times what I had. I like the smaller size too which is another reason why I got the 8. They do ship it in a generic box with a generic charger.  The charger lasted 4 days and broke, good thing my old charger works on it. I've only had it for a week but so far, so good. I will update my review after I've had the phone longer.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Even though I purchased a renewed phone, I can\'t tell it from a new one and am very impressed with quality.  I didn\'t rate the fingerprint reader or the face recognition because I haven\'t (and probably won\'t) use those features.  The battery life is sufficient for my activities, so it gets a 5-star rating.  I don\'t play games or watch videos on it so far (since I\'m an old geezer, lol!), but I do have a few, favorite apps I access from time to time.  If you\'re not really tech savvy (like me) and can\'t figure out how to close the apps, just google the question and you\'ll find the answer.  Closing the apps saves the battery, naturally.  (I read where some were complaining about the battery life and, if they\'re not closing the apps, this may be the culprit.)<br><br>I had an old Android before and would never go back since purchasing an iPhone.  I\'ve read the iPhone is much more intuitive to use.  Now, I have demonstrated such to myself.<br><br>The camera is quite an improvement over the one in my Android.  (The Android couldn\'t flip the view in order to take a selfie for one thing.)  I\'ve taken some really beautiful, true-to-color (imo) photos with the iPhone 8--comparable to my expensive (for me) Canon Rebel AND I don\'t have to change lenses for closeups, lol!  Phone camera seems to take care of shake automatically, too.  I\'m still learning all the features of the phone (not just the camera) and will get more proficient over time.<br><br>I really, really, love my ""new"" phone and wouldn\'t hesitate to recommend seller or purchase from them again.  This is the first time I\'ve purchased a used phone and was a little worried about purchasing a used/renewed phone, especially over the internet.  I had absolutely no problem activating it (cell provider even gave me a free SIM card) and no malfunctions for the two weeks (now) that I\'ve been using the phone.  The only thing I would recommend to some reviewers/buyers (who say their phone won\'t charge) is the plug will fit into the phone either way.  I found out it will only charge one way, however.  So, I marked that side of the plug with a dot of magic marker and have had no problem since.  (The plug in my old phone would only fit one way, so I couldn\'t screw up, lol!)  Also, there\'s a way to put the battery indicator (life percent and charging indicator) on the front of your phone (at the upper right corner).  Just google how to do this, too.  Easy-peazy!  That way, you always know if the phone is charging (by the lightning bolt on the battery symbol) and the percentage of charge.  (I think my old Android had this feature on the front as a default.  I had to direct the iPhone to do this.  That\'s not a complaint.  There may be others reading this who may not know they have to do this, either, if they want it on their front screen.)\n</span>', '<span>\n  I WANT TO RETURN THIS PHONE ASAP AND I WANT A REFUND OR ANOTHER PHONE WITH A CREDIT. I HAVE WAITED FOR DAYS FOR THIS PHONE, JUST FOR IT NOT TO WORK!!! THE PHONE DOES NOT WORKS, IT IS NOT UNLOCKED LIKE THE DESCRIPTION SAYS!!!!!!! THE SCREEN IS GONE OUT COMPLETELY, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! YOU CALL THIS SATISFACTORY CUSTOMER SERVICE,BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT SATISFYING!!!!!!!! I AM VERY UNHAPPY!!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I read many other bad reviews but mostly because of the seller they got them from I heard the phones not being unlocked or in a certain case 1 blacklisted and some just down right complained about features they didn’t include such as headphones (which was in the description not included) mines came in this generic normal box and had like 2 very small scratches very unnoticeable til I looked hard while I cleaned my finger prints off the phone but I tested the for carrier lock or black list and the phone was in great condition unlocked as advertised 92% battery this phone almost looked brand new just be cautious of your sellers because when u chose a phone different options of sellers provide your choice as well but other than that I rate ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ felt like I got a great deal for a great price very satisfied\n</span>']"

However, the product quality usually is good nowadays and there is little chance of using the warranty (I bought a Huawei P30 one year ago from Amazon and there is no problems so far).

The dual-sim version has two SIM card slots, as advertised, plus a third slot for a micro SD card. I am now using both SIMs for my local and international numbers, plus additional storage space thanks to the micro SD card I bought.

The battery life... well the battery life isn't great, but I do use it constantly as in streaming videos, music and playing games. If you're looking for a phone that's battery life will last you long without charging with or without heavy use while on the go(as in can't charge) then its not for you.

But I contacted the seller and within a very short time, I am not even sure, less than a couple hours I had a response and they took care of the issue quickly. You can't ask for more than that.

My battery lasts about four days without charging, however I'm not on my phone all of the time, it's a tool not my life. It came with a T-Mobil SIM card even though the description says that there is no SIM card, I ordered unlocked for All Carriers so I was worrying a little but I bought a Trac Phone BYOP SIM card kit and swapped it out...no problems.The reason that I bought the phone was because my old Galaxy Sky Pro software version was not compatible with our new car, I have to say that this phone works fine with our Toyota Prius and saved us at least $700.

Overall a decent buy since we have new phones and our monthly payment didnt go up.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I found zero flaws with the product except maybe some very slight screen scratches (which honestly is probably from me having it in my pocket with keys). Works fine on Verizon\'s network. Took the SIM card straight out of my iPhone 5s and put it in this one at the Verizon store, and at first it said ""Sprint"" up in the corner but then it found the correct network and has had no problems connecting to Verizon\'s network since.

I can't say enough for the professionalism and effectiveness of the customer service.<br><br>I am thrilled with the operation of the phone. Call and sound quality is very good. The display is sharp and bright. Exactly what I expected. Configuration was easy. I chose to not migrate anything to ensure that any aspects of the configuration of the old phone, which was slow and full of glitches were not introduced to the new phone. The processor is quick, and battery life is very good. It can run all day on a charge with regular use and constant playback of audio books.<br><br>The phone would be a great deal at the full price. However, with the lower price due to it being renewed and not being the latest model, I feel that it is an exceptional value. Best choice that I could have made.\n</span>""]"

I asked for a exchange for the same phone this time one that works with CDMA (not GSM) and my request was ignored. Why does the seller advertise ""All network carriers: untruthfully?

The transfer was so near perfect that the IPhone 8 migrated all my WhatsApp messages, which I was expecting to lose (because I don\'t use icloud). The migration was near perfect because for some apps or platforms, I needed to type in the initial passwords again (even though they were transferred to and saved on the IPhone 8) - just the slight bother of retyping a few passwords one more time.<br><br>By the way, I am a Singapore buyer, and this order was routed through an Oregon transshipment facility, before it was shipped to Singapore.<br><br>What\'s the takeaway I can offer in this review?

So here\'s my 5-star thumbs up!\n</span>', '<span>\n  came exactly how I expected\n</span>', '<span>\n  I purchased this refurbished phone 3/7/2020 for $229.96.  Prior to purchasing the phone, I  asked about the battery life.  Now, the battery is dead as of 8/5/2020, less than 5 months after purchase.  Usage cost me $45.99/month average based on purchase price.  I could have had a current brand new  IPhone for that monthly usage cost.  Do not use this vendor.  They should have replaced the battery as a good will gesture even if past warranty date.  As a business owner, that is how I would have taken care of a customer to earn future business from them.  Shame on ELECTRONIC DEALS.<br><br>Reply from  vendor:<br>Hi Brigitte, we are very sorry to hear this. Unfortunately, the order is past 90 days old and the warranty period has expired. We suggest taking the device in to Apple or a local authorized Apple technician for repair.<br>We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences caused.<br><br>Kind Regards,<br>ELECTRONIC DEALS FAMILY &amp; STAFF\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone worked perfectly!! But it had few scratches on it which they didn’t mention on the description.. false advertisement.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I like this, but I think I should have gone with the 8 plus, this thing is tiny in my hand.  One thing I'm not a fan of is that Apple seems to have taken away the ability to make my own custom ringtones for the thing.  It's one of two things that makes me keep thinking of going to android, but I have bought so much music, TV shows, and movies on iTunes, that the idea of doing it is a bit daunting.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I received my product on 05/21/20 and it upon opening my package, everything seemed okay. I went to turn on the phone and it seemed dead. No biggie, I could charge it and it’ll work. Wrong.<br><br>The first red flag: the plastic covering on the charger was loose and came off of the metal attachment to the chord. I was able to slide it up and down the actual wire.<br><br>Second red flag: I had put the phone on the charger and left for about 30 minutes, expecting my newly unboxed purchase to be nearly charged. Wrong.<br><br>The phone didn’t even turn on. I had it charging for two hours, tried multiple power-up techniques, all to no success. My phone is faulty. It’s just a lifeless piece of glass and metal.<br><br>I won’t get into the shipping because that’s another story. But after shipping delays and paying additional shipping charges, it’s a little frustrating receiving a phone I can’t even use. I will be returning the device tomorrow and will not be ordering from this seller again.<br><br>I should have taken the negative reviews seriously. Maybe if there wasn’t a pandemic my order would have been fulfilled, but I can’t take that chance again.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone itself looks great and works perfectly! Honestly it was in better shape than I expected.<br><br>The battery life was really bad. It could only hold a charge for a few hours so I had to have it replaced at the Apple store.<br><br>Within just a few minutes of me leaving my original feedback  the company that sold it to me (Hybrid IT) called me directly and offered to pay for the battery replacement (which they did).<br><br>Just simply wow! In less than 10 minutes they called me and made it right.<br><br>If you want one of these phones I highly recommend you choose the vendor Hybrid IT for it.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Phone was manufactured for Asian markets therefore I am unable to silence the camera shutter sound. Returning for refund.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I am a 12 year old girl, and I payed my own money for this phone. It came in the mail on the last day that it said it would, so kind of on time. The only cosmetic problem is that the outer ring of the camera is a bit scratched, but you can hardly see it. The touch screen works perfectly. The fingerprint reader doesn’t read your finger when your hands are sweaty, but that is the only time. I put in my left thumb, right thumb, left pointer, and right pointer into the thing and all of them work 99% of the time. The battery life is good, but I leave it on dark mode, True Tone off, and I always like to keep the brightness down. The phone adapts to the brightness of your surroundings, and so if you’re in a dark room, it goes dark and vice versa. Overall the phone is great, and I definitely recommend it, especially for the price. I hope that this review is helpful.\n</span>']"

Idk if I should return it, bring it in for a diagnosis or what, but if anyone can help me with this please let me know, 🤦🏻\u200d♂️ Thanks in advance (COULD) be the recent update🤔 “bootloop”)<br>*UPDATE UPDATE* 2 weeks after purchase<br>So it would turn out that it WAS the phone (apple) and not the seller (obviously) because of the recent 12.4 update🤦🏻\u200d♂️. I was experimenting with different settings, to see what could’ve triggered it until I tried force rebooting the phone consecutively until I thought it had enough lol. So far I think it’s fixed but if not, ig I’ll update again 🤷🏻\u200d♂️ lmao.\n</span>""]"

Then i charged it and the battery started draining without me even using it so i was just beside myside myself.  I contacted Amazon they contacted the seller and the seller responded immediately and told me to send it back to them.  They said they would replace it with the same phone, which i didnt believe, i thought they were going to send me a different phone and hope that it would do, I expressed that to them and they assured me they would send the exact same phone.  Well they contacted me and let me know they received my returned phone and that the replacement was on the way.  I received it two days later and it was the same phone with a better battery and I am absolutely in love with this phone.  Ladies if you have not seen or tried this phone you need to order it and just try it you wont believe a phone could be this pretty and functional.  Its not the latest galaxy but if you are not hung up on that you will love this phone.  This seller I'm telling you, customer service is everything and they are at the top of my list for tech products.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I purchased this to be my new daily driver when my IPhone that i've had for about 5 years finally began to give out. I get much better service in every location that I used to use my phone, and the phone is compatible with 5G if your area has it. The battery life has been phenomenal, even though I run the phone on high performance settings and max resolution. Overall I'm very satisfied, for $350 there's no better deal.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Only had the phone 1 day now, so I will update my review if anything changes...<br><br>The phone came in working condotion, with wall charger. I'm giving 5 stars due to the working phone and price... but I want to acknowledge the dirt/scratches.<br><br>I understand the scratches (shown in photos) are due to the phone being used/renewed. But it could have been cleaned up better. The ports (charger/headphone) and screen edges have visible dirt (as shown in photos).\n</span>"", '<span>\n  So im writing it as a 4 star for now because i just got the phone.  Buying a refurb saved me about $300 off the cost of one new.  It came in a generic box, but the phone was in excellent condition.  The setup was relativly easy, the phone walks you through everything.  So far i love it.  Its easy to use, has so many functions, and was needed.  The model is a few years old but thats what i do, i dont need a 1500$ phone to make calls and texts just because its new.  This one is good.  The battery lasts about two days right now.  Ill update in about six months to see how its hanging in there.  So far, im impressed and happy with the product<br>L\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Got this to replace my Verizon S7 when I moved to T-Mobile and some features were NOT happen about the switch. First, I love Samsungs mostly because IT ISN'T APPLE. The most loved feature of the series (by me) is the waterproof nature... I'm a first responder so I never really know what the scene will be like if/when I use my phone. The finger print thing is new to me, it seems ok except when I have this in a hands-free holder in my truck, just need to use the pin then... but I never had to lock my S7. Seems to be doing the trick, battery life is a little shorter than the S7 connectivity is good, screen is good so it does it's purpose. I've paired this with an OtterBox Commuter case and the ArmorSuit Military Shield Protector (also used on the S7) and I have no complaints with this set up.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I bought two of these devices for my kids. Not as described at all. I first received the Lilac Purple phone and it was in rough condition. The phone had a sticky old protector on it, smelled of cheap perfume, the finger sensor was scratched down to the metal, and last but not least NOT UNLOCKED. Owned by Sprint. The second phone was Black and the only defect here were a few deep scratched in the screen that you could definitely see from farther than 12 inches away as the description states. Don\'t waste your time or money on these. Total waste of my time and effort. Returned them as soon as I could get to the UPS Store. I will go through a reputable seller next time and beware of Amazons ""Renewed"" services.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I'm an android  user and Verizon service. Purchased as a replacement phone that was in Hospice.  Setup was a breeze,  switch of the sim card, phone was operable in 5 minutes.  Purposely got the one with more internal storage I needed the space.  Everything was an easy transfer with my Google account. I did purchase another  USB c cord, the one came with the box was okay. Highly suggest purchasing a phone case that has the rubber anti shock that comes over the edge, the screen glass is very sensitive and will crack.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Wow! What a beautiful reconditioned phone!! It came in very well packed/protected. No scratches or anything, whatsoever! It includes a USB C cable with wall charger - I am ordering the car charger separately, but no big deal. The price is AMAZING! Really great seller: shipped fast and it is the most beautiful phone I've ever owned! Features are great (as always by Samsung and Google!) and the battery life is fantastic! It stays full for a long time. Thank you for providing this devices to people like me: I cannot see myself, ever!, buying a new $600-$1000 device! What for?? As long as we have honest and great sellers like this one, you cannot go wrong! I am saving this seller for sure! :D :D\n</span>"", '<span>\n  this was the worst purchase I’ve ever made on amazon the phone said refurbished but apparently it was not done properly as shortly after i received it the phone speaker stop working seller refused to replace it or effect repairs will not be buying from them any more also passing on this to my friends and associates do not buy they are not reliable also no good customer service\n</span>', ""<span>\n  So far I like the phone. It's taking a little effort to get used to it. The transition from my old phone to the new phone did not go well. AI lost all my apps so now I am in the process of reloading all my apps and opening them all up and setting passwords and settings and all that crap. But the phone's making it easier. The phone is a renewed phone it looks like a brand new phone it came with a screen protector on it the only problem is the one corner of the screen protector has a bubble underneath it. but it's out of the way where it doesn't interfere with the vision on the screen the camera seems pretty cool I'm satisfied so far.\n</span>""]"

The description says minimal to no visible wear; however, the inch long gouge smack in the middle of the screen says otherwise. There are tons of micro-scratches all over the screen visible when held at an angle to light, but the gouge is way too distracting and obvious all the time (screen on or off, even looking straight on) so unfortunately I had to return it.

My experience went as follows.<br><br>Upon receiving the phone the right side of the screen was popping up a little, and if it was pushed down into the phone it would cause a blemish to appear in the middle of the phone. No biggie, I just need it to perform basic actions and not die. Here's where the second issue comes in to play. Upon receiving the phone the battery was already at 70% integrity. After the 90-day warranty that integrity was below 50, and now my phone has turned off and refuses to charge. I still have my old phone so this isn't too much of an issue, however now I'm out 240+ dollars and an iPhone.<br><br>I realize beggars can't be choosers, but you're honestly much better off getting a refurbished phone from a store.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I bought a used iphone 8 and it was amazon certified. I opened it and saw no scratches or any damage whatsoever. I wanted to use it for a while before I did a review. I have had it about a month now and I havent had any issues at all with the phone's performance. Battery lasts a long time, no dropped calls and fast internet connection regardless of wifi/no wifi.<br><br>I was so leery about getting a used phone. I've always gone new. When I saw it was only $200, it's worth a shot vs spending $800 on a new phone again. They gave me a 90 day return policy as well for the piece of mind. So far, this was the best bang-for-buck deal rather than buying a new phone. As long as I dont have any issues in the near future, I will continue to buy used phones from Amazon that are certified.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted an iPhone for a long time. The phone was in really nice condition. It did have an 1 1/4” slight scratch on the screen, but once I put on the tempered glass screen protector on you could barely even notice it. All functions of the phone are in working order. Very happy with this purchase.\n</span>']"

Then I found I could use speaker phone mode but it didn't work well. Finally I took it to the Genius bar and it turned out the microphones on the bottom of the phone are dead.  Repair cost is $350, which is the cost of the phone.<br>Needless to say I am not going to buy from this vendor again.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I purchased this iPhone 8 (with the Renewed Premium Guarantee) for my daughter.  It arrived in excellent condition.  However, the first day she had it, the phone would crash and restart when the battery reached about 40%.  This happened again over the next couple days.  I went into the battery settings (see attached screen shot) and found that the battery was seriously degraded, even though it was supposed to be in ""similar to new"" condition with a guaranteed capacity of at least 90%.  So I called Amazon Customer Support for a replacement phone.  It was a cumbersome process.  The Amazon representative had to contact Apple, and he and I were on hold with Apple for about 20 minutes.  When the Apple representative got on the line, the Amazon rep left the call.  The Apple rep remotely ran battery diagnostics and confirmed that the battery was failing.  She then told me the phone was out of warranty and wanted to quote out-of-warranty pricing to me for a new battery.  I objected, stating that Amazon was guaranteeing this phone for a year and wondering why I had to pay for anything at this point.  She then had to talk with her manager, and again I was on hold for several minutes.  She came back and said that I would have to talk with Amazon about the phone.  So I took the case number she gave and called Amazon back.  I was on hold again for a few minutes with Amazon, but when the customer service rep came on the line, I explained the scenario and she took care of the replacement immediately.  I received the new phone the next day.  It arrived in excellent condition and thus far seems to be working perfectly.  Everyone I talked to, both at Amazon and at Apple, was very nice and easy to deal with, it just took a lot of my time to resolve the problem.  All told, I was on the phone for about an hour and five minutes just to get the phone replaced.  I am satisfied with the replacement, I just wish the process would have taken less time.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I am really blown away by this purchase. It arrived three days early, in PRISTINE condition.  I work remotely, so having a device that cooperates is essential.  The sound quality is out of this world, with the storage capacity of 256GB I am off the walls happy!!!!! I am the Director of a Public High School and am on my phone constantly.  The speed and again STORAGE is unbelievable.  I would recommend looking into the seller of the various negative comments that were left in order to tease out who to purchase from.  This device was sold through KISS Electronics.  You'll see they have overwhelmingly positive reviews.  Happy to answer any questions.  Couldn't be happier!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This has been the first time I tried buying a refurbished phone, and I was a bit nervous about, but I have been really happy about it.<br>I received the phone, and it looks as good as new, no scrathes etc. It did not come with the original charger from apple, but that was not really a problem.<br><br>I have not noticed anything not functioning, or being slightly off. Battery life seems great, I have had no technical problems with it. I also did not have any problems with connecting to my sim card and phone company, I have T-Mobile.<br><br>I think it is a great way to save some money on what is already a pretty expensive phone brand, and I can recommend doing this.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Bought this from the verizon store.. I bought the phone during thanksgiving time as renewed. Used it pretty much lightly as I don't make too many calls or install apps, etc. Around march the phone battery stopped working and I had to keep the phone plugged in at all times to work. Then, the battery completely died and phone wouldn't work even when connected..and screen got lifted..<br><br>So watch out for the device.. Can't trust renewed devices anymore..\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  This phone is great. We are on fixed incomes and didn't want to spend an outrageous amount of money to upgrade from our iPhone 6. So, we purchased this refurbished phone from Amazon and have been very pleased. The phone, although used, looks absolutely brand new and operates like a new phone as well. We were so pleased with the phone I got, that my husband bought a similar one from Amazon just last week. Thank you for making options like this available for people who don't need, want, or can afford the latest and greatest gadgets.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The sim card tray was extremely hard to get out.  Then I realized my phone came in with 84% battery life.  I didn’t realize that a battery should be replaced at 80 percent.  Had I realized, I would have passed on this seller.  Refurbished is one thing.  Bad battery life is another.  They were pretty arrogant in their email.  So BEWARE!  Your phone could come almost needed a replaced battery.<br><br>My sister bought a refurbished phone from Amazon from another seller for around the same price and her battery life is 98%.  So I’d recommend shopping around!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I ordered the fully unlocked version. When it came in the mail it was in new condition, no scratches or dings, and it came with the charger and tool to get my sim card out. We have a plan with Verizon, I was able to take out my sim from my old IPhone and put it in this one and it turned on and loaded all my stuff with zero issues. My phone is working fine and the battery life is just as good if not better than my last phone. So far no bugs or glitches. I'm very happy with my purchase. There were a lot of mixed reviews so I was skeptical on buying it but I'm glad I did! Plus it came with an amazon backed warranty so if one came defective I didn't feel like I would loose my money. My advice would be to pay close attention to your selection when adding the phone to your cart for service options and when in doubt go for the fully unlocked version.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Second try for an Amazon refurbished iPhone.

The phone works good for me, I've had it for a couple of days, although the battery capacity is at 89%, it can hold up to 2, 2 and a half days with talking and surfing, no charging. It doesn't restart, as some comments here say, which was what I was worried about and really the value for money is great. Apart from a couple of dinges on the side, visually the phone was great, it even had a protector on. For the people complaining that the battery capacity is not at 100%, just go change it, it's like 20 bucks and don't forget this is not a brand new phone, so for a refurbished phone that I got I can say I am pleased.\n</span>""]"

The device arrived in nice packaging with a third party charger and lightning cable, and even included a SIM removal tool (a nice touch, it's way easier to use than trying to jam a paperclip into the SIM hole)<br><br>The good: The metal sides and glass back of the phone are in impeccable condition, indistinguishable from that of a new iPhone right out of the box. The buttons, cameras, sensors, and microphones all appear to be in normal working order.<br><br>The okay: Battery health is at 89%; obviously not as good as that of a brand new phone, but actually better than most of the other certified refurbished iPhones I have purchased on Amazon.<br><br>The bad: The screen is NOT in perfect condition. There is a scratch in the lower left quadrant of the screen, ~ 3/4 of a centimeter long that is clearly visible in normal usage when viewed against a light background. The stereo speakers sound clearly distorted, especially at louder volumes. Apple advertises the 8 Plus as having louder, better stereo speakers than those on the iPhone 7 Plus, but the stereo speakers on my iPhone 7 Plus sound WAY better than those on my iPhone 8 Plus (my 7 Plus speakers can get pretty loud without sounding distorted or blown out).<br><br>Conclusion: I know it may sound like I'm being too harsh in my review of this iPhone 8 Plus. I'm sure that many people would be totally fine using this phone as their everyday phone without issue, and I may continue to use this phone as my main phone for the time being because I'm strongly considering upgrading this fall. I might just tolerate this phone's flaws for until then, because it is still such a pain in the ass to migrate from one iPhone to another.<br><br>But I cannot help but be disappointed because this clearly doesn't live up to the excellent standard I became accustomed to with the 3 other Certified Refurbished iPhones I purchased on Amazon.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Phone looks great, work good so far.

In the past I depended on Siri a lot, so it has been a big problem. And then I missed my 90-day guarantee window to get the problem resolved.  Know why?

So the best I can say is that it is a functioning, if poorly, iPhone. The seller offers a refund, but I will have to buy another phone to use before I can send this one back.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  The phone I have now works so well, it's in seemingly perfect condition! For what I paid for a used phone, I feel the seller deserves praise for the product at the end of the day. I wish I could give four stars. There were several communication issues/ product issues that I felt took this order in a wonky direction. 1.) The order was sent to my address with signature required. When I asked to remove the required signature (I'm not home all the time), the package was sent the next day to a location one state away. Rather than spend another four to five days without a phone, I chose to drive a half hour through a different state to pick up the package at the FedEx facility. Okay.<br>2.) The first phone stopped working after a few weeks. Believe me, being without a phone for a few days can be a risky issue (I don't even have a phone at home, what if I had to call 911? My employer? Etc.) They gave me a VERY quick and flexible response, saying they would replace or return the phone. Amazing response! They told me to remove my iCloud info and delete the email app, which was impossible because it wouldn't even turn on, but no problem, they removed the iCloud account and email when I turned it in somehow. However, they did not mention that I would have to hold onto the SIM card!<br>So they sent me a new iPhone, nice model, everything fine, except- no SIM card. 3.) No SIM card. By this time the world was in the middle of an epidemic crisis, my carrier was closed except for in one location (fine) but the carrier veritably chased me away yelling at me to call because they had no functioning service (not fine - no phone.) After all the drama I figured out how to call them without activation on my own. A few days later I got the SIM. Anyway, the NEW phone works outstandingly, the exchange was smooth, they were very fast at messaging and did a terrific job of offering me an exchange immediately with no extra fees. However the lack of notice about a signature requirement upon delivery, the first phone battery stopping completely, and the lack of communication about holding my old SIM card backed up my phone use. I'm all set now though. Four stars.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I almost never write reviews--I think it's worth doing so here.  Many of them here scared me.  But, given that it was half the price of what my mobile carrier sold, I took the plunge and bought the product.  I waited with morbid curiosity for it to arrive after seeing all of the negative reviews here.  It arrived several days early and had one very small crack on the bottom left-hand corner that I really had to spend some time looking for to see why on earth it needed refurbished in the first place.  Within 48 hours, I made a larger blemish to the poor R2D2 when I dropped it screen-side-down on my hard floors in my apartment  Luckily, the relatively small cracked section that my spectacular feat of juggling awesomeness caused didn't affect the visible part of the screen and added my own personal touch to the party,  I guess, so the disaster mostly was avoided.  This experience made me come to terms with the fact that it's only a matter of time before this device accidentally ends up in my commode.  Pro Tip: I highly recommend ordering a case as soon as you order this so you don't end up like me.<br><br>The iPhone has no issues whatsoever absent its operator, who is a darned klutz that never should be allowed to handle electronics absent close adult supervision.  In all seriousness, I am thrilled with this purchase  Apple designed them to be slippery.

The home button is recessed below the surface of the face plate and it isn't centered. It works but has a much different feel from my other iphone. 2. There is a large dark spot on the top right of the screen. 3 The battery life is 85% which is my reason for getting a different iphone.  The description stated Renewed (New). I suspect the screen has been replaced as well. I will be returning the phone tomorrow..\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phones were dirty and grimy. Visible scratches on screen. The worst was batter lasted for about an hour on both units. couldnt connect to the data plan of my carrier.

Unfortunately they mistakenly told me it was. So I bought it. Come to find out this phone does NOT work through their AT&amp;T SIM/towers. They advised that it should work with T-Mobile compatible SIM/towers. So I took the phone over to MetroPCS (a T-Mobile partner), then to T-Mobile itself, and confirmed in both cases that the phone does NOT work with them either. Now I've spent untold hours on numerous support calls and chats, doing extensive research, visiting phone shops, and still don't have a working phone. Not only that but I spent extra money buying a SIM adapter.<br><br>Anyone considering buying this phone ought to do extreme due diligence about ascertaining a wireless provider beforehand. I would love if someone could say here what service (as of Sep 2018) this phone actually DOES work with, in the US. I could update this review if I could actually get the product to work, but for now, to me, the phone is worthless and I've only wasted countless hours on it. Very unsatisfied.<br><br>The phone also does not come with any instructions, but for a 3-page foldout with a pictograph on how to insert the SIM card.

It's so inexpensive I don't have to worry about her losing it.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  My daughter broke her smart phone. So I wanted a quick and simple replacement that didn't involve social media. (She can buy all that on her own dime.) The phone works perfect for our needs.<br><br> Sound is super loud, phone has held up to some abuse, and battery is perfect.  I subtracted one star for the camera feature.  It exists,  but the phone memory is so small it won't even allow you to take or receive any photos.

It's been kicked, dropped, tossed. And recently withstood moisture.  We powered it off for 48 hours and it loves to tell another day!! The sim card needs the largest adapter piece for it to be used.

I didn't realize when I heard people talking about 2G going away that it had to do with ability to make and receive calls, I thought 3G referred to data.  I was wrong.  The SIM card from TING I used was working just fine in two other phones, but could not work in this.  After much back and forth with technical support, who conferred with their parent network of T Mobile, the phone is not 3G, therefore towers that carry more than 911 connectivity are limited.

It's good for emergency uses, but I was stuck using it for a few months.

SIM1 could not send or receive texts. I didn't bother trying to call anyone using slot 1.<br> Overall, if you just need something to tide you over for a few days to a couple weeks, this is okay.

According to Amazon, this should be like new, but all 4 corners have damage. The back is heavily scratched. The screen has been replaced with an aftermarket product. The battery health is at 80%, barely meeting the minimum requirement. There’s nothing about this phone that is like new or refurbished. It just looks like someone’s old beat up used phone. Amazon needs to either change the product description or get rid of some third-party sellers.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I could not be happier with this purchase. My phone looks and functions like brand new. I’m so glad I decided to go this route instead of paying over double for a new phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Very happy with my purchase! I just “upgraded” from my refurbished,  unlocked iPhone 6 64GB, and this phone is a great value for the money. I could not justify shelling out more than $1,000 for a phone, so after researching i settled on the iPhone 8 64GB in gold.  I shopped around, and decided to purchase on amazon because of  the Amazon Renewed policy, as well as the ability to purchase 2 year accident protection. My phone arrived with a few very light scratches on the screen (as described), which doesn’t bother me one bit as I always add a glass screen protector. The speed and functionality are also perfect, and setup was easy.  The battery life is not as great as expected, but not enough of an issue to decrease the rating. I purchased from BREED. Highly recommend!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I purchased iPhone 8 64GB fully unlocked for my oldest one, he uses without phone service.<br>He likes it because he can join the group chat through iMessage with his classmates and I like it because I can monitor his usages.<br>the phone seems working decent for a used one.<br><br>I am planning to get another one for my deaf child as well, because iPhone has a feature to pair hearing devices directly stream, phone calls, movies, music, and etc. its the best for bilateral CI implants.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  \xa0Fingerprint works great<br>Battery life is at 91%<br>There's a really small faint scratch at the back of the phone . Nothing major. I seriously  dont mind at all barley noticable.<br><br>The phone was actually  sim unlocked  i got it activated  with AT&amp;T. Great buy<br><br>I bought it as a gift my sister will love it. It was a great affordable price I was looking for nice phone as cheap as possible you provided it thank you\n</span>""]"

Took it to the att store, and of course it didn\'t work. Forgot the box at the att store, so i can\'t return it, but I\'m not sure it\'s even worth it anyway. Extremely disappointed.

I am usually very kind with the stars.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I bought two of these phones, one for each car, so I could connect quickly and safely to emergency services.  One of the drawbacks of a smart phone is that they are TOO COMPLICATED and TIME-CONSUMING to operate in an emergency, such as reporting debris on the freeway or calling in an impaired driver.  Smart phones of any significant size are difficult or impossible to use one-handed ... and those MENUS !<br><br>These Blu Tank II phones are small, lightweight with excellent battery life, can make a one-handed speed dial call from off to connected in seconds with just two real buttons to press.  And SpeedTalk SIM cards only cost $5/month each.  Wife refers to them as ""Tickytack"" phones.  Whatever.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  It's like the year 2008 again, where I have a phone that simply doesn't need charging after 2-3 days.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Works fine with T-Mobile plan. Very basic... we use it as our back-up phone. Phone interface is not as intuitive as it could be (actually its really confusing). I can't fairly rate the pic quality bc it doesn't come with enough memory to actually take one. But that feature us inconsequential for us anyway. Good cheap little phone. Says the battery will last 30 days on standby so that is nice (we've only had it for a day though, so I can't verify that). Way cheaper than the basic phones in the cell phone stores and gets the job done.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This must be the phone with the worst user interface ever. Very unintuitive, have to press buttons many times to accomplish simple functions. My 15-year old Samsung flip phone was way easier to use. The middle button is hard to use, have to click it several times to register.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Phone does not work with T-Mobile even though the phone did try and transfer some<br>Contacts from the SIM card I put into it.<br><br>Although the radio does work and the speak sounds pretty good and the flashlight feature is good enough.<br><br>The battery life I can’t test so that’s why it’s 1 star.

If something happens, I put my sim and the battery in, and can stay connected for a week. In addition, most phones with FM radios require headphones to serve as the antenna. This phone can play FM without needing any extra wires. As far as functionality, it makes calls and texts fine. The menus are a little bit hard to navigate, and it does have bluetooth.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I ordered this phone in the hopes of finding a non-smart phone to use as an emergency phone for my elementary age daughters. I planned to use this with the Ting SIM card, which I believe was compatible, however Ting did not offer service for that type of phone for our rural midwest area. It's a cute little phone though and seems very well made - I wish we had been able to use it.\n</span>""]"

Received it two days before it was estimated to arrive. I have never purchased an item that has been refurbished as I have always been wary of authenticity of the product, however everything works great. The camera works great, and the speakers are very loud and clear. My main concern when considering to buy was how I wasn’t able to know the phones physical condition before buying. It seems as though there’s a scuff or small dent in all four corners of the phone but seeing as I am putting a thick case on it they’re not visible and as such I’m not worried about them. I am very glad that there are no scratches whatsoever on the screen, however there were two deep scratches on the back, but luckily no other scratches besides those. It doesn’t seem like there’s any other issues. Overall, I’m pleased with the product, it’d be a 10/10 from me if there wasn’t any physical damage to the phone but overall, I’d rather pay for this than a new phone at full price. I’d buy it again. Also, got authentic charger and charging adapter, unfortunately I didn’t receive any headphones :/ but good purchase all around\n</span>', ""<span>\n  A certified refurbished phone should be free from any defects. I received the phone with a screen protector on it, below it were 4 huge gouges you can see from any angle through the screen protector. I didn't expect to pay 500 dollars for a phone with such a damaged screen. Normal wear and tear I could understand, like some typical screen scratches. These were gouges however and is very upsetting. My 14 year old little girl had been asking me for this phone before school started. I promised her I would get it, then I received this damaged and gouged phone and in order to fix it I would have to send it back (4days) then get my refund (4 days) then reorder (3 days with prime). If I'm lucky, if not then they will say they will repair it and I'll have to wait even longer not fulfilling my promise.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I AM VERY DISAPOINTED. AT FIRST, I WAS EXITED THINKING I HAVE A GOOD QUALITY PHONE AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT, THE PHONE CONTINUOUSLY SHOT OFF ABRUPTLY SEVERAL TIMES A DAY; I COULD BE BROWSING THE WEB, TEXTING, OR EVEN TRYING TO MAKE PHONE CALLS AND THE PHONE JUST SHOTS OFF AND THEN BACK ON AFTER A FEW MINUTES. NOW THE PHONE HAS COMPLETELY SHOT OFF, IT HAS BEEN HOURS NOW AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TURN IT BACK ON. I AM VERY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED, I HAVE SO MANY THINGS/INFORMATION SAVED ON THAT PHONE, I DID NOT EVEN GET A CHANCE TO BACK UP EVERYTHING NOR DID I GET THE CHANCE TO DELETE ALL MY INFO FROM THE PHONE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I PURCHASED A PHONE ON AMAZON; NEVER AGAIN.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Paid 580.00 for the 8 Plus. Its trash. Its black with deep scratches in it (scratches are so deep on the phone that they appear sliver against the black phone making it look even worst).  The Screen goes blank and phone re-starts every 2 mins. Then I realized the battery won charge. After leaving it on the charger for 5 plus hours it still read 1% charged. Complete garbage! Now, I have to put up a fight to get my money back...\n</span>', '<span>\n  We just received the phone but so far my daughter loves it. Gold as described and the seller Exclusives Direct convinced me with the awesome reviews. Great buy and great price.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I received my iPhone 8 Plus right on time. The box was well packed and the iPhone looks like new with no scratches. Inside the box was a sim ejector tool, Ul certified adapter and MFL certified cable. It also included a clear phone case and screen protector..yayyy.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I had some fear when ordering this renewed cell phone, but it arrived very fast, I already have a few months using it and the truth is the same as ordering a new cell phone, everything is in order, the software arrived flawlessly without a scratch, with absolutely nothing, I have been using the battery for months and it is still as if it were new, I do not regret it, very good purchase.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was hesitant on ordering a new unlocked phone from Amazon but I’m honestly!! I’m glad I did , it really surprised me when it came down to how clean the iphone looked (8Plus) . It didn’t come with a legit iPhone charger but it still came with an alternative. I have plenty of other iPhone chargers  so it didn’t bother me I just needed the iphone. Since it was my first time trying this out i thought the iphone I bought wasn’t unlocked at first because when I would put my Metro PCS SIM Card in the SIM card holder of the new phone in the top left corner it would still read [No SIM].  So that’s when I took it upon myself to look on YouTube &amp; get down to the reason why , and YouTube was helpful! I figured out that I had to call my phone carrier and let them know I wanted to switch to a new phone using my current SIM Card, and all they needed was basic information from me as far as my account info and also the IMEI # of the new iphone I purchased! &amp; keep in mind there is a fee for switching over that will be added to your next phone bill or right then while talking to a representative , if you have Metro PCS my fee came to $55 &amp; some change..  So after that was taken care of I just took my SIM Card out of my old iphone and placed it in the SIM Card holder of the new iphone &amp; next thing I know everything worked out fine! I do recommend that you have all your passwords for your Apple ID /Apps ready along with having your iphone backed up so it will be easy to do a simple transfer 🙂<br>I hope this helps someone who’s  thinking about purchasing a phone from Amazon!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I ordered this phone and was sooo exited about using it, I got it, change the sim from my old phone, and it worked a couple hours and died. I am not giving up, hoping I can find a decent refurbished phone on Amazon.

This phone worked great in the beginning, then it took a dive within a couple of months.  The keypad wouldn't work, wouldn't hold a charge for very long, and wouldn't ring from incoming calls.  Took it back to AT&amp;T under warranty who told me I would receive a brand new one in the mail and to immediately return the defective phone I had within 7 days or I would be charged another $59.99 and in addition they (AT&amp;T) would inspect the phone to be sure I didn't damage it.  Well I jumped through their hoops and received the same phone as a new replacement, however it lasted maybe another month or two longer than the first one before the same thing happened.  We took it back to AT&amp;T and they said the only thing they could do under warranty was replace it again with the same, which I refused to do so here I am out $59.99 and to place my review anywhere I can including AT&amp;T to say DON'T BUY THIS PHONE it is worthless!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  This a great basic phone.

Nothing else out there as of 2019.<br>· The AMOLED display looks fantastic. I found it a joy when watching or reading anything from this screen.<br>· I found the fingerprint reader to be very sensitive and quick.<br>· The Aura Glow is something I honestly thought I would hate. But this rainbow effect is a beautiful look because you don’t see a rainbow but, depending on the angle of the phone, you only see one color. Look from a different angle I get a different color. Very creative and something new in a world of black and white phones.<br>· The video editor is super easy to trim and add music to your clips. I did see that it does work with Adobe Premiere Rush, so that’s a big smile for all your move makers on the go. I will also say, using the pen is a lifesaver when you’re trying to trim seconds of a clip on a smartphone.<br>· For a phone like this, battery life is very good. From 0-100% it only took an hour, and as an average phone user, a full day charge, with the 25-watt charging they provided, will bring my phone around 20% battery life left. Samsung has a 45 W charger than can cut the time in half of the charging, but you need to pay extra for that one. Still impressive.<br>· The S Pen is shorter and thinner than it looks in person.<br>· The Pen does an excellent job of converting my weak handwriting into a text. All you have to do is write your note, tap the text area, and press an onscreen “Convert” button. For English grammar, it worked flawlessly for me. I see the use of this feature if you need to take a quick note asap.<br>· You can sync the Note 10 to your windows desktop (Dex mode). I haven’t tested this feature out, as you’ll need a USB-C to USB-C, but I do love that you have a mini laptop hard drive in your pocket. Just connect it to a computer and the phone will mirror its screen on to your monitor. I can see this super useful if you need to do presentations at work. Just put the PowerPoint file in your phone and connect it to your computer at work.<br>· Another cool feature in the video making world for this phone is the “zoom-in mic” feature. If you don’t have an extension microphone, the phone will use the mics that it has, but not at the same time. When recording, it will the mics on the front of the phone to record your voice, making it clearer. And if you zoom in the mic sensitivity will increase, like having a boom mic. I didn’t test this fully as you’ll need to spend some time comparing this feature, but from basic video playback, the mics are spot on. Samsung is putting up its gain for anyone who wants to film.<br>· Taking photos or videos in very difficult places, the S pen will be your best friend. You can begin filming, or taking, shots, by just clicking on the S pen. It’s a small feature, but I believe is one of the most useful to have.<br>· The stabilization is excellent. I was just walking while filming, and it looks like the phone was on a wire. This is the best stabilization I’ve seen on a phone so far. Well done Samsung.<br>· You have revers charging with this phone, which will, of course, kill your battery. But still, cool to have.<br>· The AR Doodle feature is really cute if your taking photos with friends. I took a picture of just random people and this feature allows me to draw anywhere on the pic without destroying it. Using the pen, making hats and mustaches can make even boring pictures funny.<br>· The Live Focus mode main function is to let you blur out the background. I did like this a lot because you can just block anyone in the background that doesn’t fit your “perfect” picture. It does work well if your object is focused before taking your shot.<br>· The cameras are…well…there just great. Sharp, colorful, ultra-wide provides the same color profile/quality as close up zoom. The details that these cameras can provide is beyond words. I have nothing to say on the overall outcome a smartphone camera like this. It’s the top of the class until Google’s Pixel comes into play.<br>· The sound is also great. It doesn’t come to any specific location, but rather throughout the phone. Samsung built the volume deep in the phone so it can go everywhere, are you will never cover it with your hands. Loud and crisp (no base though).<br>· Playing games like Alto’s Odyssey had no issues other than getting noticeably warm after 40 minutes, which makes sense for that power. Also thanks to the support of UFS 3.0 specification, you’re going to get faster loading times (This was hard to test how much of an impact it has on the phones day-to-day activities, but all I can say is that I had little to none loading time).<br><br>Cons and Oks:__________<br>· It’s the end. No more headphone jack. Bringing so much joy and now Samsung’s closest ally has let it go.<br>· The night mode is good, but it’s still nowhere compared to phones like Google. Samsung has yet to master the night mode shots as their system is to up the ISO and slow the shutter speed. They did up there game, but it’s still not enough to get great night shots. I’m overall getting a busy shot and using the telephoto and ultra-wide lenses are both useless at night.<br>· No microSD card slot on the Note 10.<br>· The ultra-wide sometimes creates a fisheye effect. You will see this effect more if there are some bright/mixed colors at the end of your pictures (like a tree or a building with windows). I did notice that I got a slight bend at the way end of my pictures, which makes the image look weird. The solution I found was just to crop the image. I hope software updates will fix this.<br>· With a group of people walking in the background, there were times that the phone had a hard time trying to get focused on the person I was taking. This happens when trying to use the regular and telephoto lenses.<br>· The telephoto lenses tend to over sharpen my images. Taking a close pic of a rose I saw this issue come up. Now for a regular person, this is no issue at all, but for a photographers eye, you’ll see this.<br>· Be warned, get a case. An all-glass design makes writing with the pen a slippery task. I felt more concern holding the phone than what I was writing, so I knew this a must-have case.<br>· You can only write short notes with the pen. I notice that you can’t even write a full sentence on a single line if you wanted the phone to convert your writing into a text.<br>· 45-watt charger cost extra.<br>· The front-facing camera is…well, it’s a front-facing camera. Nowhere near as good as the back, but good enough for having meetings.<br>· Samsung’s keyboard is horrible to use. If you get this download Gboard, it’s the best in smartphone keyboards.<br>· The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is fast, but even the tiniest dirt on your finger, it makes the process a little slower. Nothing really impressive on this if your hands are sweaty or dirty.<br>· I hate the fact that you have to go to your notifications to shut down the phone. Holding the power button activated Bixby, you can change this if you want. To be honest, Bixby isn’t the best around, so I’ll always change it.<br>· The S pen Air Actions are a neat little tool to use, but I saw more as an accessory than a tool. I didn’t feel the need to use this feature, but it does work. It also does take some practice to get the hang of it but it’s irrelevant for the day to day use.<br>· The battery drains at a pretty consistent rate. The beauty of the device is the screen, but it’s the most that kills the battery.<br>· Every single space on this phone is a fingerprint magnet.<br>· This phone does have a little more weight than your average smartphone.<br><br>Bottom Line:__________<br><br>Samsung is putting the stops in making this a phone for filming. With an almost bezel-less display, an excellent video editing program, and a great battery life, the theory is supported. I admire the premium layout of this phone as the S-pen is very fun to use (but not yet a priority in daily use), the screen is just beautiful, and the system as a whole is excellent.<br><br>There are some issues with the cameras on this phone, like the “night mode” inaccurate pictures, and I also wish they moved the front-facing camera to the side like before (even though the little black camera is small, it’s still noticeable.). But the honest truth is that I really have nothing super negative about it. Some small issues are there, but I know software updates will fix these problems, or at least I hope they can.<br><br>Overall: A phone enjoyed for everyone, but built for those who want to film.<br><br>Hope I was a help to you.<br>Love,<br>Honest Reviewer\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This is my second International Version Galaxy Note. I find it absolutely ridiculous to buy a phone for $1100-$1500 when I can buy it for about $800-850. The international versions work perfectly and are typically dual sim if you need that function. A quick note (hehe, see what I did there?), My Last phone was the Galaxy Note 8, I only bought a new phone because, after two and a half years of use, the battery no longer lasted more than 5 hours and my screen had finally cracked after dropping it about 30 times...<br><br>The phone:<br><br>Pros:<br>-Great Camera- I love all of the features that Samsung has included including using gestures and the S-Pen for Camera control<br>- Fast<br>-Good Battery Life. Fast charge. It will still be on 40% by the end of the day, but they've made the system much smarter and it will turn various background running programs to conserve battery.<br>-Delivers everything you expect from the Flagship phone and more<br>-The international version always includes an adequate case in the box. I've never bought new directly from Samsung US, so I don't know if this is the case for the US Version.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Finger Print ID: This tends to need extra pressure on the sensor to read your fingerprint. Luckily I have both Finger and FaceREC set up, so if one isn't working fast enough, the other does.<br>-Layout (this is a personal preference) It has changed since the Note8, and I don't like it. They're minor changes, like the Prompts at the bottom for Closing apps, Home and Back. And there may be a way to edit these and I just haven't figured it out yet.<br><br>Overall, I love the phone, and Samsung has delivered again!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This is my second time buying from the seller. And I must say I was very happy and pleased. Phone arrived before time and everything was in perfect order. I will recommend the seller.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  So far I'm loving this. I have no idea what the bad reviews are about. I got this to replace a ROG Phone II because I didn't like how there was nothing to protect from intrusion by dust and water. For almost everything I do, it's nearly as fast, and for some things it's faster. If you haven't used a Samsung phone before, the One UI 2.0 is really good as far as making sure that things run well, and the speakers despite being side-firing are a treat.<br><br>My favorite feature has to be how the S-Pen lets you use the phone underwater. With only one point of contact - the pen - it is able to figure out what you're touching by looking for the pen and ignoring your fingers. If I'd been told about this I'd probably have jumped on board a long time ago.<br><br>The biggest con for me is that the S-Pen isn't integrated into almost anything. I imagined that I'd be able to swish it around to scroll every window, use gestures to go to the top and bottom of web pages, click the button to go Back, double-click it to view Recent Apps, and none of that exists. It's just there for writing and doing gestures in the Samsung apps. This is a huge missed opportunity and is minus one star for me.<br><br>Otherwise, loving it! Big screen, durable, the whole shebang. If you're a mobile artist like me, there's no other game in town. Every other stylus phone has a worse camera, worse specs, or is lacking in some other way. Got it with full awareness that the S20 was coming out and I just don't care. The Note offers the feature set for me, and that's more important.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Phone is ok.<br>I thought it had US warranty. The seller evaded that until later.<br>The international adapter is cheap and unoriginal.<br>I only gave 4 stars since phone is the main thing. I bought my previous phone, note 9, fron NGP.<br>I trust their phones.<br>Stvsyl\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I love this phone, it is pretty much my dream phone. It has everything I wanted. There are a couple of things to keep in mind though. Since this is the international version, certain Samsung apps are region locked. I can't use Samsung Pay or Galaxy Play on this version since I am in the US. Not a big deal for me since I probably wouldn't use Samsung Pay anyway, or Galaxy Play, since I use Steam Link. But if those are important features for you, you might need to shell out for the US version.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Awesome phone for someone with 2 numbers that only want to carry one phone.\n</span>', '<span class=""cr-original-review-content"">\n  Es demasiado el tiempo de demora en llegar el equipo, desde que lo compre hasta la fecha no he podido recibir el equipo.

The phone was for my wife and she likes the shutter sound (who knows why?) so zero problem either way. Phone arrived indistinguishable from new. Shiny and scratch free. Setup was easy.

DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON look elsewhere!<br><br>Same day phone was activated I had to call amazon and tell them the phone was defective and speakers were not producing any sound. The representative I spoke to said to take the phone to an authorized repair facility and submit the receipt for reimbursement. That’s what I did, once the receipt was submitted they told me they couldn’t give me a credit to my original payment and the previous representative was wrong! So now I’ve paid nearly $700 for a used phone that I could have purchased brand new for less with a warranty. Not to mention when Best Buy took it apart they found multiple internal components were 3rd party and not genuine Apple parts so they couldn’t repair the original problem- now the phone doesn’t even turn on.  Customer  service from Amazon gets a ZERO!!!!!!!!<br><br>They had no problem taking my money but when there was a problem they refused to stand by their representatives corrective information or warranty!<br><br>Not happy - will not order from Amazon again. I expect this from Walmart not Amazon.<br><br>Zero stars!!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  So, I got the phone, didn’t work on my carrier.. but the customer service people helped so I can get my money back which I appericiate. Also, the phone looked perfect when I got it it, but when it came it was dead so I had to charge it.\n</span>', '<span>\n  This phone was advertised to work with AT&amp;T’s network.

You wouldn’t know it was refurbished or renewed. I’ve been using it for a few days and it works and operates without any issues. It came with a perfectly installed tempered glass screen protector so I didn’t have to buy one. Great phone!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  This phone was advertised as “renewed” yet when I got it the paint was scratched near the camera lenses and more importantly the battery capacity is under 90%. As I write this review I can see the battery draining. (It went down 5%) This battery was fully charged 5 hours ago. Just sitting there with no activity it went down to 86%, and I just got it yesterday. I called Amazon BEFORE I purchased this phone to find out about this “renewed” program. The Amazon rep stated that “renewed” is like brand new. Well, having scratches near the camera, and a battery capacity that is under 90% is NOT “like new” it is “like used”.  I am now noticing a discoloring at the bottom of the screen. This is just another scam like “refurbished” is. I have sent in my refund request. For all the trouble I went through in setting up this phone I could pay 50$ more and go to the Apple Store to get a better phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  The product was amazing, everything works perfect and arrived sooner than expected\n</span>', '<span>\n  I love this phone.

Seller sent it in very timely manner and very nicely packaged. I end up returning it and seller issued a refund also in timely manners. Overall the services provided by seller is the best. But unfortunately seller didn't write in description about sound defective. It was almost impossible to talk without turning speaker on. The voice so bad and split kind sometimes very hard for me to understand and others complained same. The button on side used manually to turn sound high also not functioning well enough. When I turned button to highest sound as soon I release it i seen volume gets low automatically again. First I thought to get it fixed on my own using local iphone repair shop but later decided to simply return it. I love iphone 8 plus size its size very nice too. Overall my experience is not good as I wasted my so much time in switching all data setting it up and them cleaning that up switching again to old iphone 5 very frustrating....but will start over. I advise instead of buying refurbished better get some local prepaid services with new phone contract.....\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I want to give this seller a most excellent review. The phone is top notch condition, if there is an imperfection, which I CANNOT detect it is covered by the new casing which I’m equally happy with! Most importantly the screen is not damaged in any way. The phone arrived 3 days before the estimated  time by Amazon. At this point, I couldn’t be more pleased. Thank you so much 5* rating!<br>That being said. This is the iPhone 8 Plus 256g at the best price offered by an excellent dealer. I checked every rating, comparison and cons on this phones outside of the reviews listed in Amazon by other purchasers...this is the top rated back model other the XR in Apples line. It becomes a matter of what your price point is and what you ACTUALLY do with your phone. I have other devices for video games and movie watching, this is really just going to be a phone. Plus it is resolving a visual loss I am beginning to experience, I can only once again give 5*s<br>Enjoy your phone!\n</span>', '<span>\n  Came with one or two scratches and off brand accessories, but over all I’m pretty happy with it.

Other than that the phone has no scratches or dings anywhere else, battery is great, no Cloud lock and everything functions normally.<br><br>I don't know if I got lucky or people are writing fake reviews but I am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that it comes with a 90 day warranty is a plus.<br><br>Thank you for blessing me with a phone I could give to my mom cuz she loves having TouchID and having some newer features like wireless charging is a plus too (even though she's never going to use it).\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Sadly they had sent a phone that was defective and would shut down randomly, with research I found this was a hardware problem in some IPhones.

Thus, unless I use this phone is used only with AT&amp;T, the phone is useless going forward.<br>Phones advertised as AT&amp;T carrier phones should fall under the general rules and conditions of what it means to have phones locked to that carrier. AT&amp;T can unlock phones that are originally locked to them. Apparently, mine works with AT&amp;T (described as ""partially unlocked"" by AT&amp;T reps) but cannot be unlocked unless the original carrier is identified. This seller said it\'s AT&amp;T; AT&amp;T says it\'s not AT&amp;T.<br>Should it really fall to me, the consumer, who believes ""Apple iPhone 8, 64GB, Gold - For AT&amp;T"" means the phone is registered to AT&amp;T -- to resolve this issue?

However after many years and replacement batteries it finally started to show its age and would spontaneously reboot. So although I had been putting off buying a new phone and saw models come and go I was forced to look and I chose the Samsung 10+ International  model. Setting up and using it on A&amp;T network was a breeze, it took a little while getting used to the new interface and only a little regret for the loss of the Note4. I am liking it now. The 256Gb internal storage with the 256Gb sd card. It is fast and easy to use. The battery life is  amazing even with watching videos and net browsing I am getting well over 24 hours use and it charges fast. I have ditched the charger that came with it as it is an Euro plug with adapter cumbersome and replaced it with and Anker multi-port charger. I like the face recognition unlock it's easier than the long passwords I use. I'm still customizing it I didn't transfer my apps from my old phone wanted to start with a clean slate as always when I move to something new. I am an amateur photographer and almost never go anywhere without a camera so I was pleased to see that this phone has a quality camera built into it. I chose International because I didn't want any chance of it being loaded up with any phone companies software crap. It's fine it does come standard with SI units selected but that is easy to fix.<br><br>Samsung Please understand that your registration and support app it too cumbersome and too complex to setup what's more why can't I have one login for all of my devices why insist on a different login for each I have enough to keep track with I am one person with many many devices. Would it be too difficult for me to have one login for me instead of telling me that name is in use choose another.<br><br>The Screen is bright the detail is fine it would be nice to be able to magnify all screens, sometimes my eyes don't resolve so well and reading the fine writing becomes difficult. I know I could use a magnifying glass the screen is that good. but to be able to zoom in to read some things would be nice.<br><br>I'm still exploring the capabilities and am not really disappointed with anything yet, it is a great phone, hope it lasts as long as my Note 4. Oh yes I would recommend it to anyone that needs a seriously sharp phone.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Didn't use the phone well..but heard any lots of features and I was extremely interested\n</span>""]"

THANKFULLY it was still on limited warranty (the person who bought it originally must have had the limited warranty through 6/2020), so I got everything covered for free. HOWEVER, it was a hassle to get fixed and I was quite upset that this phone I purchased for $529 had so many things wrong with it.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Do not buy this phone.

The capability of this phone, despite it being one model year old, is striking (Many of its features are superior even to the current iPhone 11, including the OLED screen).  The battery life has been better than expected for a renewed device, likely because it is only one model year old.  I have larger hands, but I prefer the 5.8 inch size for one-handed use.  If you are looking for a foray into the Apple ecosphere, this opportunity is hard to beat.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Was nervous ordering refurbished but I cannot see any evidence it was ever touched.

It was delivered in like new condition and until recently has acted like new. Recently, the phone's charging receptacle stopped working without finagling the connector. I have tried 3 different Apple branded charging wires and chargers and it's the same with all 3. I have to insert and re-insert the Lightning wire several times, hold it just right, carefully place it at an angle and set a weight on the phone by the connector. Only then will it charge.

The 1st one came with a busted mic, meaning someone on the other end could not hear me talking during a phone call. The 2nd and 3rd orders came from a different vendor and both had the same issue: busted speakers. It was a case in which the left speaker wasn’t equal with the right speaker. Like when you listen to a song with only one earbud. That was how all sound came out of the phone. Some sounds came in clear and other sounds came in muffled and in the background. I know this sounds a bit picky, but if I’m paying $500+ for a phone, having the speakers output properly is important to me. You can do speaker tests on YouTube but I do not believe this is a test that amazon runs they’re phones through, since the same problem occurred twice in a row.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Great customer service because they accepted the return with no hassle and free return label.

UPDATE 2/27/20- after being unable to get into the phone to delete apple account bc THE PHONE COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING &amp; WOULD NOT TURN ON AT ALL ... they are unable to process a refund... unable to get into apple ID(own fault recovery was linked to old phone number) we are out $400 and the iPhone that has already been returned and IS IN THEIR POSSESSION... COMPLETELY SCAM, had they sold us a functioning phone NONE of this would be happening... reporting to amazon as well. Lesson learned and I SHOULD HAVE listened to the reviews prior to purchasing.<br><br>We received this phone and within 2 days it shuts off randomly, goes all black, blank or red screen.. when turned back on, all white lines appear all over the phone... about 15 TIMES A DAY (with full battery). Contacted seller to see what we are going to do about this obvious defective phone that was not cheap... hoping to just swap the item purchased for one that is not defective.. stay tuned.<br>**This review is subject to change once a response is received or the issued is resolved** UPDATED 2/27/20\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This was the first time buying a used refurbished cell phone instead of getting a new one.  The reason is simple, the price.  The renewed iPhone 8+ came via FedEx a few days after it was ordered, packaged in new box and well protected.  The screen already had a glass protector on it but showed no evident scratches.  The back of the phone showed no signs of wear either.  Came with a generic new, listed as certified charger and cable, did not try those yet.  Used an Apple charger and cable to charge it, which was quick.  Mirroring the apps, contacts and details from the old iPhone to this one was slick and maybe took 20-30 minutes.  It is supposed to come with a sim card removal tool/pin, there was none, but I had one already. Easy to change.  Once changed and powered, verified with Verizon rep that the phone was showing up on the network.  Battery life is good for a full day's typical use but that can be subjective since everyone uses their phone differently.  So far so good, a worthwhile purchase.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I loved the color, picture, 256 GB..all fantastic BUT when I leave home or enter an area with no wifi the phone states No Service..I thought it was TMobile's fault and called 5x to complain with them resetting phone, switching SIM..sometimes it worked. I may have had 3 hours of use when not on wifi over a 12 day period.(just returned it) Very frustrating as this color is hard to come by.

If you are here, you know how good it is or what you may not like about it. I am coming from an original Pixel, so this one is easily familiar, but much more polished.<br>Renewed Products: Wanted to go Renewed to get more for the buck. Also, I like the idea of reducing electronic waste by purchasing used. I got a perfect phone. No indication it was even used before. I have Verizon, so activation was as simple as switching the sim card.<br>Choice of Seller: Decided to purchase through this seller's Amazon storage account instead of direct just because I trust Amazon's shipping network. Could have gotten it $10 cheaper by going straight to the seller (still using Amazon's payment portal). Took me a bit to figure out that was the difference. Also went with this seller (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_sellerprofile_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;isAmazonFulfilled=1&amp;marketplaceSeller=1&amp;orderID=112-1429733-4635438&amp;seller=AO1LGXGNS33JB) due to his overwhelming good reviews. Fewer reviews, sure, but I also liked the content of them better.<br>Shipping: Two days as promised. Safe container. Came with another Amazon order, so it was nicely ensconced with other packages in a bigger box. Another reason to purchase from the Amazon storage facility.<br>Contents: I received a charging cable and adapter from Amazon Basics. That is fine with me. NOTE: I still had my connector cable from my original Pixel. It was necessary to transfer all the data. If you don't have a cable like this, you will need to purchase one separately.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Purchased my Google Pixel 3 based on the raves about the camera and will say it has completely lived up to the expectations there. The device itself works well in everything but one area - IT WON'T RING. Phone calls particularly, but also text notifications, just don't happen and suddenly I see a voicemail (if the caller chose to leave one) when the phone has been right beside me with ring and vibrate notifications all the way up. If I reset the phone, it works for a few calls and then STOPS RINGING again. Have tried everything recommended in online forums and still only sporadic performance. Apparently this is a known problem that still has not been addressed. I'm working around it for now, but as a freelancer (and a mom) this is a big problem.

It came with a non OEM charger (Shark brand?!) and did not have the ear buds or the transfer plug included. The battery arrived at 0%. Also with light scratches on the screen and DIRT around the bezel it would be hard to give it more than an 8 out of 10 ranking.

If anything it has more than I need and it's made using the voice assistance, something I wasn't really comfortable doing previously, easy and inviting.<br><br>I'm still figuring out how to navigate/manage group chatting with apple phone people.

It comes with a staggering 130000mah battery which can give you about 30 days of standby time which is ridiculous for a smartphone. One great feature about this smartphone is that it acts as a battery pack too so its perfect for those long trips and adventures. The interface is extremely smooth and lag free (see video). Camera quality is superb for both front and back cameras. I would say that this is the ultimate travel phone or for the perfect poweruser. It's pretty much indestructible if your not deliberately trying to break it. Its rustproof, waterproof, drop proof, break proof! I got this for my brother because hes always playing MMORPG games on his phone and is always running out of battery at days end, with this phone's battery - its able to last him the entire day of mobile gaming!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Bought this for my son for Christmas. The battery is amazing. He uses his phone like any other teenager, alot, and goes about 4 days between charges.

It's a little heavy,but it should be with the features it has ! Aps run smoothly,and set up was easy. I had contact with customer service.

It also comes with unlisted features like a game mode, auto app cleaning, and a display to tell you how much ram is in use at the tab screen. Bloatwear is also near nonexistent.<br><br> Overall a solid phone with insane build quality at a good price.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  My original review is inaccurate. I was mistaken. The outstanding customer service department at Blackview sent me a replacement and WOW, this new device is amazing. It does everything so well. Fast processor, a large, bright screen, an easy to navigate Android 9, best speakers and call quality in a smartphone, and a battery that lasted me 7 days with heavy use. Add to that the attractive, sturdy chassis, and wonderful customer service, what's not to like? I highly recommend this phone to all!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Purchased this phone because of a positive review on Unbox Therapy. I had been searching for a T-Mobile compatible phone under $300 with a long lasting battery. The Blackview fit the bill. The battery contributes to a heavier phone but my big hands handle it just fine. This phone can last up to 30 days with light use and 5 to 7 days with heavier use. I\'m a ""streamer"" and use it as a hotspot as well. I also boondock camp off grid. The rugged exterior handles being dropped or getting wet. Great phone for outdoor use.\n</span>', '<span>\n  This phone is a rugged BEAST!! Solid. Weighty. Big Screen! Super useful features. Awesome phone security. Incredible battery life AND can actually charge other devices! Loud external speakers. Incredibly affordable!\n</span>', '<span>\n  Just what it said it was love this phone\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Great battery, gorgeous resolution, tough chassis, with some issues. Power button is so easily pressed that I find my phone constantly rebooting because of the slightest constant contact with pocket or holster. Signal is variable where there should be constant and consistent bars as proven by every other phone I've owned previously. The processor is weak, something I did read in the previews from tech magazines. Games and videos lag, buffers take considerably longer than previous phones I've owned (2 to 7 seconds roughly timed, where the previous phone (doogee s90) was nearly instantaneous to a couple of seconds). If you don't mind waiting or lag, this phone is great. Battery life is incredible. Constant use over nearly fourteen hours dropped the battery to just under 50%. Also, the screen is incredibly sensitive, making it incredibly easy to use.\n</span>""]"

My main issue was that there was no clear way to adjust call volume which was not quite loud enough in some situations.  The back fell off rather easily as well.  The manual was tiny and had very little useful information.  At first it was difficult to figure out how to load the SIM cards.  One faces up and the other one down and you have to slide down a metal bracket that holds the SIMs which is not mentioned in the manual.  The user interface is easy enough to learn.

CONS: not very user friendly, has no instruction manual, you cannot hear the phone ring even in a fairly quiet room, the alarm on its loudest is faint from a short distance, the cell reception is very poor with constant dropped calls making it not good for long conversations. I would not recommend buying this phone unless you just need it for an emergent situation, but even then you will be struggling to get a good signal and your conversation will blip in and out making it hard to for whom ever is listening to understand you.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Nothing wrong with the phone as far as I can tell.

Underneath the screen protector were two large scratches, visible from arms length when the screen was off or dim. As someone who prefers dark mode, this was a bit annoying. The product description says no scratches are visible at arms length, but this is either false or they mean when the screen is on bright.<br><br>The screen protector was of poor quality: it collected fuzz and hair on the edges where the adhesive was exposed. When I removed the screen protector, I found that underneath it were many very fine scratches in addition to the previously mentioned deeper scratches.<br><br>It appears that the seller uses screen protectors to hide the scratches on the screen.<br><br>The device was shipped in a thin aftermarket box in a plastic padded envelope. I would have preferred that a fragile, glass front and back, electronic device would be worth enough to ship in a box with more adequate packing materials.<br><br>On the plus side, the battery health is 97%, and the rest of the frame is in immaculate condition. No dust in the ports or speaker grille. No visible damage to waterproofing ring.<br><br>Total, I rate this a 3/5: it's half the price of Apple Certified refurbished, but the damage to the screen is impossible to ignore. Next time I will spend more from a more reputable seller. For the amount I paid I don't feel like I got a good deal, but I also don't feel like I got a super bad deal.

I contacted Amazon for a partial refund since I could not return the phone because I’m currently on a business trip but all I got was it wasn’t possible... please be careful when u purchase this item\n</span>', '<span>\n  i orderd a phone for my son and when it came it was not the phone i even ordred it was a different cell phone so i had to return it\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I received my iPhone a few weeks ago and wanted to wait some time to use the phone before iI posted my review.

They even provided the necessary tool to change sim-cards from phone to phone, which was useful.

This item came with a battery at 88% of max capacity. I asked the vendor about their policy toward batteries in refurbished iPhone and they stated anything greater than 80% of max capacity is within Amazon’s guidelines.<br><br>I am content with that for an iPhone XS 256gb at the $567 price point.

In my case, you would never know that it was a refurbished phone.<br><br>As far as the phone itself, I grow to love it more and more everyday. The OLED screen is incredible, face recognition is excellent, the camera and videos are really amazing, wireless charging is a great feature, and the battery life is such an improvement from my previous phone, which had the battery replaced once before. As a plus, iOS 13 runs beautifully on this phone and I'm really enjoying the added features. I could easily see myself having this phone for years to come, provided I don't break or lose it...Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an upgrade but wants to save $200+ dollars on a new iPhone.<br><br>PS I purchased my phone with Kiss Electronics.

Amazon may say that up to 80% is ok, but my current iPhone is at 87% battery life and can’t go without charging every 4-5 hours. So 80% is BS.<br>I’ll keep the phone as it is a good value for the money and i need a phone. I can pay Apple to change the battery in a year, but honestly, I think I’ll tell my friends to get refurnished from Apple. It has a better warranty, new case and battery. Worth the additional expense, in my opinion.\n</span>', '<span>\n  To my dismay, my phone started getting VERY hot for no reason, then my screen started going out. I took it to Apple and they asked me ""Where did you get this fixed?"". I was confused. They said that BOTH the SCREEN and BATTERY were NOT APPLE, and instead were cheap replacement parts, and that they wouldn\'t service it. I\'m not out $500 that I paid for a cheap knockoff. I suspected this might be the case because the screen was... bland, and the XS is supposed to have a magnificent ""OLED"" screen.<br><br>This is 3.5 months after purchase.<br><br>Pros: It did come with a nice screen protector on it. It also worked with my ATT sim card.<br><br>I don\'t know if this is an Amazon wide problem, or if it\'s just this seller, but I feel like I\'ve been scammed. All I know is I paid for something and got a cheap knockoff that died. I\'m actually a law student and you can bet as soon as I pass the bar, I\'m filing an ""implied warranty"" suit out of principal; look it up if you\'ve ever been told something is ""out of warranty"" but feel like it was \'supposed\' to last at least that long.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This seller is selling STOLEN phones DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!<br>Purchased the phone back in May and now my service blocked my phone saying that somebody reported it stolen. I didn't report my own phone stolen so it must have been the seller or whoever, the seller purchased the phone from. Either way, it isn't worth the risk. It May work for a little bit but they will report your phone stolen and you'll be out of your money. I repeat DO NOT BUY, THEY ARE SELLING STOLEN PHONES!!!!\n</span>""]"

Many people cannot wait to upgrade...our family just waits for people to do just that and for companies to refurbish perfectly good phones.  This one came in less than 6 days, all functions working properly, just as advertised was unlocked, bluetooth transfer of data in less than 30 minutes.  The only slightly negative comment is that the refurbished phone came with generic charger and not Apple products.  No ear bud jack in this phone, so remember to get wireless earbuds.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  So embarrassing.

Not a scratch on it works great and came with a wall charger and cord\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone arrived in great condition. No visible scratches and everything seems to work. Very pleased with the fit and finish. The battery health reads 79% after a few days of use, when I thought to check it. Entirely possible the vendor shipped it with 80% remaining.<br><br>I am replacing an Xr, and I have to say I forgot how limited my last iPhone 8’s battery capacity was when it gave up the ghost. If you are replacing an iPhone 8 this may not be a big deal, but I’m going to have to charge multiple times a day if I talk for any amount of time. Just keep charges around your home, office, and vehicles and this shouldn’t be a problem. I feel that was the one trade off I made with a refreshed unit-battery life.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I bought this phone because it was specifically unlocked to AT&amp;T.

I don't have time for this.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I love the phone but it was not 256G only 64G and I really wanted the phone for the storage. I could have gotten a cheaper phone by just getting the iPhone 6s that was advertised as 64G! I hate I didn’t get to save money since the phone is the exact phone I already had but I had already promised my little sister my old phone and didn’t want to make her wait by sending this one back for false advertising. Great quality and was boxed very professionally!\n</span>', '<span>\n  As expected, the battery was not at 100% capacity but it was higher than expected at 89%.<br>There’s practically no scratches on the back or front of the phone and everything seems to be in excellent working order.<br>I did not expect a charger or screen protector to come with the purchase but it did! The screen protector was already in place so I didn’t have to use the one I bought and I will be saving the charger the phone arrived with in case I need it later.<br>This was listed as a FULLY UNLOCKED iPhone and I believe it has arrived as such, it will definitely work for the carrier I initially intended, which is Cricket.<br>I believe my little sister has a step up from this phone (the 8 Plus) and she’s still paying for her phone through the provider. I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before this so I’m glad it worked out, if anything happens within the next 90 days before the Amazon warranty expires I’ll be sure to update. Definitely would buy the protection plan in addition to the phone, as accidents do happen.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Don’t be discouraged if it comes in a Verizon box! I was and I have Metro PCS.

It's flat display with a highend chipset and good cameras is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately it has a few small flaws that will have me returning it.<br><br>1. 6gb of ram, not the end of the world. But, it does hold back the 865 from performing as well as it can. Again not a huge deal, but I felt I should mention it.<br><br>2. Too dim of a screen, this is the killer for me. No matter if on automatic brightness or not. The maximum screen brightness is too dim for me in outdoor scenarios and the screen washes out too easily. This is the reason I feel like I have to return this phone.<br><br>Too be fair, if you don't need or use your phone in outdoor lighting, this thing is great otherwise.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Around 2 years ago, I ditched my iPhone 8 Plus for a Samsung Galaxy S10e. All at once, I was frustrated with what I was missing sticking with Apple. Why should I continue to pay more for $800+ phoned without OLED screens, with only one camera, and with needlessly restrictive software, when things on the Android side of the smartphone game are better than ever? I switched and never looked back.<br><br>As my time with the S10e wore on, I was troubled by the direction Samsung seemed to be taking. Their prices were going up, and their technology was not advancing at the rate I had once found wonder in. The S20 starting at $999 was just icing on the cake of fear; had Samsung led us all on? What phone was next for me when my S10e finally gave up the ghost? I pushed away OnePlus, Google, and other midrange phone manufacturers for months; until the announcement came.<br><br>I picked up my S20 FE 5G on launch day, and have been blown away by it every second of ownership. For a $700 dollar phone, it blows all preconceived notions of ""midrange"" out of the water. For starters, the screen is absurd. An HDR10+, 120 Hz, Super AMOLED of this size? Are you kidding? It\'s amazing. And the 4500 mAh battery has no issues driving it; I\'ve gone a couple of days between charges by this point. The cameras are absurd too, especially the 32 MP selfie camera; the sharpness is honestly too much sometimes.<br><br>Also, the plastic back is nothing to worry about in the slightest. Not only is it actually aesthetically pleasing, but it\'s solid and easy to grip. I have no qualms there. The phone as a whole is lightning-fast in kind. As a Verizon user, my 5G experience is very limited, so I can\'t attest to it\'s usefulness in this review; but I\'m sure it\'s fine!<br><br>My only qualm with this phone would have to be the bloatware; we should be done with all these Zynga apps being preinstalled. However, it takes 10 minutes or so to uninstall them. I can\'t knock it because of this.<br><br>Let me be clear; this phone is the way to go. We are at an amazing point for smartphones; why not really care about something you use most of the day? We go to work on our phones, we attend class on our phones, and we consume most, if not all, of our entertainment on our phones; go with something that works for you. This phone does for me to an almost fervent degree.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Enjoy the always-on OLED with punch hole.  Just peek at the phone and you know the time &amp; notifications.  Always-on is the best feature.  Perfectly happy with the styling and performance.  Wish the battery could be user accessible-but that is a personal opinion.<br><br>I was prepared to purchase a 25W charger, but after experiencing the bundled 15W, I sense that 5V 3A is nice balance between faster and cooler operation that will probably prolong the working life of the battery.  Similarly for the Qi wireless charging which is naturally inefficient and runs even hotter.  I am shopping for aftermarket chargers, but no hurry.<br><br>The set of bundled apps is unsettling and in need of attention.  A first clue was when ""calendar"" did not sync properly.  Turns out that Samsung has an entire set of unbranded applications spoofing basic Google apps including:  phone, calendar, contacts, my files, clock, gallery, messages, and more.  What is unsettling is that these Samsung apps are UNBRANDED presumably to lull consumers into believing they are Google branded apps.  It seems this required many gatekeeper failures including but not limited to:  Google App certification approved a set of  ""unbranded"" apps to exist.  The trickery continues with unbranded notifications with no explicit indication which app is requesting access to personal information.  For example, is enabling ""Find My Phone"" a prompt from Samsung, Google, the data provider, and/or some other entity?  There are also unbranded notifications that appear from hidden Apps that are not readily located such as ""Carrier Hub"".  [Try to find that in my apps.]  The many overlapping and redundant requests for permissions to parse messages, mail, files, locations, settings, behavior, calls, logs, sounds, videos,  swipes and keystrokes because concerningly invasive when the asking party is anonymous.  Some permissions such as Bixby cannot be changed.  Another sloppy mistake was a terms and conditions click to agree screen that was missing the actual terms and conditions statements.  Surely the EU, California CCPA, and other laws prohibit such deception.<br><br>The out of the box experience can be daunting.  Many steps and ""insider knowledge"" are required just to turn on and configure the phone.  Setup can be never-ending.  Each time you want to turn on the phone:  you have to pick up the phone, tap twice, wait for facial recognition to fail, swipe up, enter password, swipe up to get to a home button, hit home, then navigate to where you want to be.  Shipping an obsolete version of Android is disappointing and let\'s just say there is some opportunity for software updates to improve.<br><br>A minor tip:  The sim tool is hidden in a secret compartment of the retail box.  For my experience, the retail box is tight fitting.  After removing the top cover, it is very easy to miss a secret compartment stuck inside the top cover containing the pin used to pop open the sim slot.  There was a white piece of blank paper that made it appear to have a false top.  The useless instructions also happen to be in that compartment.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  For $600, I would say this is a pretty good phone for the price. I have had mine for a week now and am pretty satisfied. Coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy Note 8, this is a good upgrade. You can check out the specs on any Samsung's page, so I'm just going to list my personal pros and cons. Most of my cons are relatively minor when taking into account the phone is $600 new.<br><br>Pros:<br>Price - $600 new is a great price. The only other phone I was considering was the Google Pixel 5, which is $100 more.<br>Battery life - The S20 FE lasts a full day easily even with 120hz turned on. Coming from a phone with a 3-year old battery that was struggling to make it the full day, this is a big plus for me.<br>Back cameras - The back cameras are a big upgrade from my previous Note 8. The Note 8 was fine if there was enough light, but as soon as things got darker, photos went downhill. The photos I have taken so far on the S20 FE look great.<br>120hz - Scrolling and animations are very smooth. I don't play any games on my phone other than Genshin Impact or TFT once in a while, so this was a nice plus rather than a must have for me.<br>MicroSD card slot - I store all my photos on my SD card, so the S20 FE having a slot for that is nice.<br>Flat screen - As someone who quickly got annoyed with the curved edges on my old Note 8 rendering it unusable without a case, the S20 FE's flat screen is a nice change.<br>AOD - The always-on display was one of my favorite features of my Note 8 so glad to see it's still around.<br>Size - I love big phones, and I love big screens even more. The 6.5-inch display is great, and the phone is about the same size as my Note 8, which has a smaller display. I have long fingers, so I don't have much issue using the phone.<br><br>Cons:<br>No headphone jack - By far my biggest complaint with the S20 FE is the lack of a headphone jack. I don't see why it's necessary to exclude the jack on Samsung's newer phones. Seems like a ploy to get consumers to buy their overpriced wireless earbuds. I had to buy some dongles on Amazon so I could use my existing headphones.<br>Front camera quality - While the back cameras are impressive, the front camera is less so. The selfies I took with my girlfriend were kind of washed out and overly smooth. The 32mp photos don't look any better than the 8mp ones from my Note 8.<br>Touchscreen issues - I have had touchscreen issues where instead of scrolling the screen will randomly register it as clicks instead. Most noticeable on Instragram where it'll click on random profiles instead of scrolling. So far, it looks like restarting the phone fixes these issues for a few days. Hopefully Samsung fixes this with a software update.<br>Buttons - I am fine with Samsung moving the volume buttons to the right side. However, Samsung should have considered adding additional buttons to the left because now there isn't anything there. A do-not-disturb slider or a dedicated camera button would have been nice.<br><br>Overall, I would recommend this phone for anyone upgrading. For $600, you get a great phone.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I switched from Motorola to Samsung after my Z3 started dying after mere months of use. There is no way I will ever pay a thousand dollars for a phone that will be obsolete within 2-3 years. That's just not going to happen. The S20FE seemed to have 90 percent of the features of the S20 at a reasonable price so I got it. It's definitely better in most ways than the Motorola and I'm happy with it so far.<br>One thing to be aware of as soon as you power up is that stupid 120 Hz setting - turn it OFF immediately unless you want your battery dying in a couple of hours. It's really useless for most tasks and it's activated by default, which is why everyone is complaining about poor battery life. At 60 Hz my battery easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use.<br>I got the 128 Gb version with 6 Gb ram from my Verizon store since I already had an account and they gave additional discounts for immediate activation. I then added my 128 Gb micro sd card so I should finally have enough storage and app space to breathe for awhile. The phone will accept up to 1 Tb cards.<br>Screen brightness is disappointing. It's only half as bright as my $49 Samsung J3 I use to fly my drones. In fact it's only about the same brightness as my old Motorola. Not good in sunlight. Not happy about this at all. The little J3 will sear your eyes in daylight with boost mode! WTF? Why?!<br>Another major flaw is the absurdly slippery case, which constantly tries to squirt out of my pocket or hands every time I touch it. I dropped it three times while waiting for my Spigen Rugged Armor case to arrive. All those nice colors this phone comes in are pointless since you are absolutely going to drop this phone at some point without a good case to cover all the slippery surfaces. Not MIGHT drop it - you WILL drop it. It's that hard to hold onto. I also contrasted this with my trusty J3. Again, the FE loses, since the J3 has an absolutely perfect tactile surface that was designed to be held, not dropped. The J3 surface is so perfectly designed I didn't want to cover it with a case - and I have NEVER dropped it! Again I have to ask - W.T.F.??? was Samsung thinking when they designed this S20FE phone?<br>So the camera is very good for a phone camera. In fact it's better than some of my actual cameras. I experimented with photo, video, single take, slo-mo, and was very impressed with the quality I get without much effort. The 3x optical zoom I really like. It also digitally zooms to 30x in photo and 12x in video mode. I handheld full zoom with image stabilization and got surprisingly sharp results. I really like this camera. I use  Lapse It Pro when I want to take high quality time lapses so I didn't spend much time with the built in version but it seemed to do ok. There are very few adjustments on those modes.<br>Bluetooth connects very well to my speakers at high quality. Also to my fitness band. Wifi is decent as well. Where this phone is a notch above my old Motorolas is in signal sensitivity. It picks up cellular signals in places my Droids were just dead. Like in an industrial building basement with lots of concrete and steel. I still had a data connection (slow) and could text.<br>Headphones are questionable at the moment. My USB-c adapter doesn't work with this phone. I get an error saying it's not supported. Nothing at all about wired headphones in the manual. So I ordered Bluetooth buds (NOT Galaxy - since they pulled this cheap stunt I will not reward them) I ordered the TOZO T10 and will update when  I test them.<br>Phone call quality is solidly above average but not great. Another feature that is actually better on my bottom of the line J3 phone!<br>Overall, this phone is a good upper mid level option for those tired of the cheap $150 phones and don't want to spend a fortune on the latest gadget.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I am offering this review after owning the Galaxy S10E for about 1 year.<br>I got this phone after I dropped my Moto X in water and I chose the Galaxy because I have a Galaxy watch and they two are supposed to work best together.<br>I don't particularly have any complaints about the phone, it makes and receives calls. Runs the Android Apps that I find essential.  It has reasonable storage.<br>The Moto X have functions to turn on the flashlight (shake the phone) and camera (twist the phone) that I still miss  In fact, when I DO need the flashlight, I find it very cumbersome to turn on as it is a button on the pull-down settings menu.<br>THe Galaxy has a power share function so I should be able to charge my Galaxy watch from the phone.  This does work, however, you have to lay the watch on the BACK of the phone - perfectly centered and STILL.  I've had the phone in an Otterbox case the whole time I've had it and when I did need this powershare function, I had to take the phone out of the case.  The screen got scratched all to pieces the one time I tried to do this - when I went on a short trip and forgot my watch charger.  So, I wouldn't recommend using that function unless you can closely control the environment and ensure the phone doesn't get bumped and is laying on a soft and very clean surface.<br>It is a small phone - I don't have complaints about the screen per se, but when I hold it out of the case I feel like it might slip through my hands easily.<br>I have dropped it a number of times - in that Otterbox case - and it has never cracked or failed in any way.<br>I've mentioned the case a couple of times so I do want to make a disclaimer - I won't buy another Otter Box case - it is supposed to have a lifetime warranty and the corner of it is broken off...I did say that I've dropped the phone, but that corner fell off at the strangest time - in fact, I got into my car and there was a piece of blue plastic lying on my black seat after looking all around, I realized it had come off my phone case. When I contacted the manufacturer they asked me to pay them $6 or $8 to ship a new one.  That doesn't seem like much of a warranty to me.<br>Regarding the interaction with the Galaxy watch:  The Wear app doesn't do much.  It will help you find the watch if it's lost in the house. Mostly it offers you about a million different watch faces - there's a whole section of the app dedicated to the watch face.  As far as functionality, it's very hard to find apps for the watch thru that app.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I purchased this unlocked directly from Samsung.<br><br>I had this phone for about a week and the transfer and setup process using the Samsung Switch app was so bad that most of my apps didn't get downloaded. Instead there is an app icon that launches a web browser. Seriously Samsung, this is pretty basic stuff.<br><br>The software also doesn't transfer account information and app specific settings unless you're transferring from another Samsung device. Not a good strategy to get customers from other manufacturers to switch to their products.<br><br>The fingerprint reader is terrible and it sometimes it takes 5 - 6 tries to get it to work.<br><br>Pictures are blurry.<br><br>Lots of Samsung bloatware loaded on the phone constantly asking you to login to your Samsung account.<br><br>Sending this back to Samsung and will be looking at other phones. Maybe a OnePlus 8T which is comparable, but comes with more storage and memory - 256Gb and 12Gb RAM.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was skeptical about buying this phone since I was always a huawei/apple user. I got tired of apple because of the storage and my huawei phone no longer supports google due to the ban so I figured I picked up this phone despite the reviews. It is really nice. The fingerprint works well and the battery life and touch screen is nice. The screen is moderately big and it includes a microSD card for additional storage. Camera quality is decent. Its better than the iphone, but not better than the huawei one. The volume is 10x better than my iphone. Overall, for the fan edition its nice and at a decent price. It has everything a s20 has so I cant complain.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This phone achieves two really good goals, it's an amazing phone and really good value for money. You get a lot of great features and specs that are usually found in more expensive phones for the budget price. It's fast, very smooth and responsive, great camera. The plastic back might not impress some but for me it's VERY acceptable sacrifice for the lower price, I use case anyway and it's better than having glass. You just can't get a better phone for this price.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I really like this phone. It has great clarity, speed and good quality cameras. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have an LED notification of emails, texts or calls.  I know this is a bit trivial, but it is something I really miss and wish this new F20 fe 5g had. I've seen some apps that provide this notification, but they require very intrusive information gathering requirements, which I don't want either.....  The trusted places feature on my old s6 rarely worked, and the same holds true on this new s20 fe, it rarely unlocks my phone automatically when I'm at my trusted place. On the plus side, the fingerprint feature never worked on my old s6, it seems to work about 95% of the time on the s20 fe.  I have not tried the face recognition feature as of yet, so I can't comment on how well that works or doesn't. The battery life seems to be about 50% better then my old s6. I'm not a constant user of the phone like some are, so I can go two and half days between charges.  This is a really nice phone and I'm glad I upgraded from my old s6, but I can't understand why they gave up the LED notification feature.\n</span>""]"

Got the XS and everything is working great but the ear speaker sounded blown out. When a speaker sounds like that usually it means you would need a replacement, but most of the time with the X and XS it\'s just lodged with dirt and needs to be cleaned out. (again the description says ""thoroughly cleaned"" and that they test and replace defective parts... doubt it.) I really didn\'t feel like going through a return process and since that was the only thing seemingly wrong I just loosened up the dirt with a soft brush and a q-tip and used scotch tape to grab up the loose dirt.

These products are hit or miss. I ordered an iPhone 8 last year and it looked new and it’s lasted me until now. But I wanted to switch it up and treat myself and buy the iPhone XS. With prime, shipping was great and only took 2 days. When I opened it up, the box looked like it has been ran over by a car. When I opened the box up, the phone looked fine to the eye, but as soon as I played music, it sounded like the speakers were being covered with how muffled they were. And that was without a case. When talking about the front facing camera, I’m pretty sure my old iPhone 4 has a better one.<br><br>And it’s another thing to mention: in the fine print, the battery life says “they sell phones as long as they are above 80% battery life”. Mine was on 85% when I received it. Yes I wish it was higher but know that before you buy it that you MAY need to go and get a new battery inside your phone if you need it to be at 100%.<br><br>LISTEN!!!<br>Amazon Refurbished can be a great thing. They have tons of great, awesome phones. But they also have phones that are VERY cheaply made. Just be wary of that before buying.<br><br>I hope this helps y’all before you buy!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  The battery arrived at 92% capacity.

The screen is beautiful with no burned out pixels, front &amp; back glass have zero scratches.<br><br>~Camera~<br>Front &amp; back both work perfectly and the lenses are clear.<br><br>~General Functionality~<br>I switched my SIM card first then<br>I used the Bluetooth option to seamlessly change everything over from my old iPhone 6 to this XS. Each app works perfectly. The switchover from the thumbprint to Face ID was easy &amp; all of my passwords work (yay!) Upgrading from the 6 &amp; iOS 12, operating this feels so smooth and delightful.<br><br>~Packaging~<br>It came with plain white packaging, an apple branded charging cable and power brick, as well as a device to pop out the SIM card.  Honestly, besides not having the satisfaction of opening a brand new product... this feels brand new and saving hundreds of dollars feels even better.<br><br>I highly recommend trying this service. I will update my review if something changes but at this point, one week later, I’m thrilled!\n</span>', '<span>\n  Mine came dead, and the generic charger in the box doesn\'t fit this phone so I can\'t charge it to see if it works. The description says ""like new"" but the phone has noticeable scratches on both the front and back of the phone. All in, this is not at all what I was spending this amount of money to get, so I have requested a return. So far the seller hasn\'t responded, so I continue to have money tied up in a heavily used and nonfunctional phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  two different phone both said fully unlocked per amazon/seller and both were tied to a different carrier..\n</span>', '<span>\n  I had gotten this phone within 5 days and it came in almost perfect condition. The battery capacity was at 94% and it came already charged (50%). A few issues I have are that this product does NOT come with a wall outlet or a pair of headphones, nor does it come in the original apple box. The phone came in a small, white box that was wrapped in plastic. I would’ve liked better packaging but the phone wasn’t damaged at all so I can’t complain. However, the phone should have came wrapped in a plastic peel that you see most new phones have just to prevent any scratches on the screen seeing as though the phone is made of glass. The iPhone XS itself gathers fingerprints easily due to the fact that it’s glass so please invest in a case and a screen protector if that is something that bothers you. Other than these things, I do recommend this phone (try to get the 251gb version if you can). Also! If you have Metro PCS , you will probably have to pay a fee to transfer your service to your new phone (that’s if the older phone is already under this carrier). Even though this is compatible with wireless charging, I DO NOT recommend you use wireless charging as your main method of charging your device. You could wear down you’re battery faster that way.\n</span>']"

Got this for teenage son for first phone. Does the job. Is unlocked, used with T-Mobile prepaid. No issues at set up. Does have dual SIM (at least the blue one did). Can use business number on one SIM and personal number on other SIM. Doesn\'t fit my needs but thought I\'d mention it. Battery is nice and long. No decent instructions come with it so just takes time to figure everything out. Can lock the keypad by pressing the top left corner control button and the ""*"" key. However this doesn\'t prevent the phone from shutting off if the power button is held down. I don\'t like that fact but it\'s the only real complaint j have. The radio works well and my son has managed to get music on a mini SD card loaded into the phone so it acts as an MP3. Has a camera, but he and I do not believe you can send or receive photos (at least we haven\'t been able to). Durable little phone, my son is clumsy and drops things a lot so this one has held up for a month so far with no issue. No internet access on this phone (this was the whole reason we purchased it). Did not feel 13 yr old should have access to the entire world in the palm of hand. Lot of responsibility there and with this generations focus to validate self through social media, waned to keep his focus on his real life accomplishments and face to face interactions with friends. He will go through those motions on his own as all teens push for that freedoms and experience. Be for now, while he is still on the younger side of teenage years, this phone works wonderfully for us. P.S. My son has taken our encouragement to be fun with his ""outdated"" type phone in school and often makes remark as it is his Stone Age phone, enticing humor amongst his peers. He says he doesn\'t mind it being outdated and even likes that it\'s a little sturdier than his friends. (Of course he does dream for an iPhone but just thought I\'d mention it in case any other parents out there were in the same place I was and worried your child might hate you for an outdated phone. They won\'t, they know you love them and are thinking in their best interest. It shows.) Hope this review details enough for any type I future buyer.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This phone is all I could ask for out of a $30 phone. The keyboard is easy to get used to, and the user interface is very simple. It is very durable and easy to get going right away. I needed a basic phone that was rugged but didn't want to go for the old 3310 because it was too expensive, and this definitely works. I would recommend this for people that need to keep in touch with their kids, but don't fully trust them with a smart phone.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  It’s pretty poor quality. Doesn’t hold charge, shuts off randomly and never has service. It’s a shame I couldn’t return it in time.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Excellent, low cost big battery phone for a GSM network. Casing is simple plastic, but what do you expect at this price? Works well on T Mobile network and internationally. Be careful if you plan to use it for a long time on an AT&amp;T based carrier, as I think AT&amp;T plans to shut down their 2G GSM network within a year or so of the date of this review, and then I don\'t know if it will continue to work (T-Mobile has said they have no plans to follow in AT&amp;T in shutting down 2G).<br><br>This is a great phone if you plan to go overseas and buy a temporary SIM for it as a low cost emergency backup.<br><br>You may want to review the videos on youtube showing you how to insert one or more SIM cards. Don\'t expect ""super"" instructions with a phone at this price point. There is enough information on the web where this should not be an issue.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I bought these phones for friends. they are satisfied with the quality. it's a great secondary phone for making phone calls\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Great buy for the price. Worked well when I travelled abroad. Holds the battery charge for at least 48 hours.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Very impressed with this phone. I use it as an extra phone incase my main dies or breaks.

And navagation is hard to use\n</span>', '<span>\n  Great battery life, but the raised keys keep turning the phone on when pressed inside a purse, for example. Even if you lock it and turn off the key sounds, it still keeps turning the phone on. Also, pretty hard to insert SIM cards, perhaps even harder to remove.<br><br>Update: +1 star, tested in EU, works like a champ.\n</span>']"

I\'ve owned a OnePlus 3, 6, and (currently) a 7t. They\'ve always been solid phones at a solid price, undercutting the bigger players with nearly-flagship specs at mid-range prices.<br><br>So why did I even consider the Samsung S20 FE if I\'m so happy with the 7t?<br><br>Well, I have to confess. I\'m getting a $500 TMobile trade-in value on an old Google 3a I had laying around. $199 net for a brand new Samsung S series phone? Well that was too enticing not to consider.<br><br>Then there\'s this. I wanted a true wide-angle lens and better optical zoom. For as much as I love my 7t, I\'ve been longing for something with a little more versatility and quality in the camera stack. (Yeah, I take a lot of pictures.) The 7t\'s wide-angel lens isn\'t all that wide and the telephoto is about 1.7x, not 2x or even 3x.<br><br>So if I wanted a better camera setup, why not go for one of the other S series with higher res sensors and longer zooms? Because the rest of the S20 line was out of my price range. I wanted better cameras, but I\'m not insane. $1300 for the S20 Ultra and it\'s 4x zoom? No way. $1400 for the Note 20 Ultra with it\'s 5x zoom? Nuts.<br><br>$699 (with MAJOR trade-in incentives) for a Samsung S20 FE with specs to rival the OnePlus 8?<br><br>Now *that* was worth a look.<br><br>I\'m glad I looked. This may be the first time I walk away from OnePlus and land on Samsung. The jury is still out, and this is still an early review (I\'ve only had the phone for a couple of days), but so far I\'m duly impressed.<br><br>Now I won\'t belabor pixel peeping comparisons between the various phones. Pop over to Youtube and you can find comparisons between just about every phone on the market. What I will say is simply this. For $699 the Samsung S20 FE compares extremely favorably to the OnePlus 8, not to mention the rest of the phones in the Samsung S series.<br><br>So what follows is a quick rundown of the good, the bad, and the meh. I don\'t think there\'s really anything ""ugly,"" just a little ""meh.""<br><br>The Good...<br><br>* I\'ve never been a fan of the Samsung ""Edge"" style screen. I always turn it off. The S20 FE has a nice, flat, vibrant screen. You get Samsung screen brilliance in a no edgy gimmicks, 6.5"" form factor. Nearly bezel-less. Oh yeah, and it does 120hz, but for battery life purposes I\'ve dialed mine back to 60hz. I\'m not a big gamer and frankly 60hz works for me.<br><br>* The performance is perfectly acceptable. I\'ve seen benchmarks that indicate Samsung isn\'t squeezing every ounce of power out of the Qualcomm 865, but I don\'t have any complaints. I can load up everything I typically run and never encounter a slow-down. (Browser, password manager, camera, news feeds, social media, etc.)<br><br>* The battery life has been good so far, and I expect it to get a little better after it breaks in and Android does it\'s app tuning magic. I just finished my second day with about 30% left in the tank after a typical usage cycle; a TON of web browsing, a couple of Youtube videos, some social media, LOTS of messaging, a couple of calls.<br><br>* &lt;drumroll&gt; The cameras are surprisingly solid for a phone at this price point. The 12mp wide angle sensor is poppy and vibrant with TONS of detail. It\'s a bona-fide wide-angle, too, unlike my OnePlus 7t that trims a few mm off the angle. The 12mp main sensor is well matched to the wide angle, producing nearly identical exposures and saturation, with plenty of detail. Sure, everyone\'s crazy about megapixels, but 12m is plenty for most applications and I\'ve printed 12mp shots up to 20x30 in the past with good success. Now, the 8mp 3x optical telephoto is worth a special note. Yes, 8mp is a tad skimpy, but when you consider that other phones in the Galaxy S range (and other manufacturers) use a combination of pixel binning and AI magic to artificially create longer zooms, 8mp 3x optical is... well, it\'s workable. So far the results are not only usable, but quite good. At 10x the results are still usable, though I wouldn\'t use them for blow-ups. At 20x, detail is dropping off fast, far earlier than the ""space"" zoom on the higher end Galaxy S20 line with their higher resolution sensors. By 30x the photos are unusable for anything but... well, they\'re unusable. At this price point, though, the quality is quite good and I have no complaints. I\'m paying half the cost versus the other Samsungs with more advanced zoom setups, so I\'m getting about what I expect at this price. Oh yeah... I don\'t do selfies. YMMV ;) BTW... The camera software launches *faster* than the module on the Note 20 Ultra. No kidding. The bargain unit is faster than the flagship. Noticeably. Like a second or two faster. Go figure.<br><br>* Memory Card slot. Why can\'t Apple give you expandable memory? No memory expansion on the OnePlus. Why couldn\'t Samsung add it to the $799 Note 20? The S20 FE has it at $699. Winning!<br><br>* Oh yeah, and one bennie... I know a lot of people go bluetooth and live audio isn\'t as big a deal anymore. I happen to be one of those folks who likes to listen to live audio off my phone. I carry it around with me. The OnePlus 7t has always been a bit tinny for my taste, another minor annoyance. The audio on the S20 FE is actually passably rich and full. ""Passably."" This is no Bose Soundbar. It\'s just not annoying. ;)<br><br>The Bad<br><br>* Slower charging than the OnePlus 8. Come on, Samsung. You can do better than 25w charging. How can tiny little OnePlus keep beating you to the technology punch on charging?<br><br>* Plastic back. Some people don\'t like this. I\'m fine with it. I put my phones in Spigen slim cases anyway. But if you\'re spoiled by all-glass backs, this isn\'t going to win you over.<br><br>* Samsung One UI. Bloatware. Irrelevant. Childish looking. Replace it with Nova Launcher, tune it to your taste, and move on. OnePlus has a clean, crisp UI and that\'s the way it should be. Samsung needs to grow up and get rid of One UI.<br><br>* 6gig of RAM? Come on, Samsung. OnePlus routinely puts 12gig in. Now I don\'t need 12gig, and I\'ve never pushed my phone to those limits, but please, it\'s time to grow up and beef up the RAM, even at this price point.<br><br>The Meh<br><br>* 5G performance is good when you can find it, but it crushes battery life. I never run it on anything but 4G. I don\'t need 5G. I\'m not streaming 8k to my phone. I\'m just using it for the typical stuff people use a smartphone for.<br><br>* Please, for the love of the UNIVERSE, kill BIXBY! Bixby, Bixby, Bixby! KILL BIXBY! In the age of the Google Assistant and Alexa, it\'s utterly, completely useless. Why tie Bixby to a button? KILL IT! UGH!<br><br>* Who puts volume buttons on the right? Seriously. If you want to create a phone for righties, the volume buttons should fall under the index finger, not the thumb. The power button goes under the thumb, as it is on this phone. This is a bizarre design choice and OnePlus gets it right. Samsung, not so much.<br><br>* One thing OnePlus continues to add to their phones that nobody else on the Android side has added is a volume mute slider. I can\'t tell you the number of times that silly little slider has come in handy during meetings. Flip a switch. No need to open the screen. Just slide the switch. Steal the idea, Samsung. (Correction, just take inspiration from it. :) )<br><br>Bottom line...<br><br>This phone is a GREAT value for the price. At this price point it\'s in the same league as the OnePlus 8 and in some subtle ways it\'s a notch better. The only reason anyone would spend any more money than this would be to get gimmicks and pointless performance bumps. Save your money. Make it a Galaxy S20 FE or a OnePlus 8.\n</span>']"

Maybe I used it in the wrong way.<br>Overall, the experience was bad, already returned for a refund. Never known a refurbished item could have a such bad screen feeling. Gonna purchase something else instead. Could be a pleasure if the seller returned funds real quick. :)\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Arrived a day early and in flawless condition. It even had tempered glass screen protector on it. Battery condition is 100%, all features work as new, you wouldn't be able to look at this phone vs. a new phone from the factory and tell a difference. You can't expect perfection when you're buying renewed (refurbished) items, but that's what I got.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I wish I could give this seller 0 stars! I was sent a phone with a defective screen and Kiss refuses to refund me after I sent it back within the guarantee window. They say the phone was damaged due to misuse which is completely false. How is it misuse when the phone had a protective case and a screen protector and the phone was not dropped? If you're willing to risk $600 on a phone you don't know will work, go ahead. Otherwise, buy it from a different seller.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  WOW! I’m a very skeptical shopper. I thought the description and the price for my phone was too good to be true. My phone was an exact match of the description and I could not be happier. Absolutely spotless, free of marks or scratches.<br>The battery life is currently the same what would be on a new phone.<br>Impressed with the seller’s ability to match a description with the product.<br>I was very skeptical since pictures were not even posted of the phone.<br>I just shopped for months and went with the best seller reviews. Which is why I am choosing to leave you with my experience.<br>No doubt I will buy from this seller again.\n</span>', '<span>\n  So I received my renewed phone yesterday, so I was going to play with it and set it up before I wrote my review. Though I new it wasn’t going to come with the original packaging, it still came in a very nice box so the phone was very protected during travel. It came with a charger and a sim tray opener. Cosmetically the phone is fantastic. It has the tiniest scratch near the top of the screen but I only noticed because I was looking. It isn’t easily seen and can’t be felt. I do think there is a little bit of dust in the speakers but they still work fine and nothing is muffled. Another thing I was worried about was the battery life, but luckily this phone came with 96% battery health! It is also still covered by the original Apple warranty which is also really unexpected. Overall it was such a relief to receive a phone in such great condition and I would definitely recommend this phone and the seller TRADEMORE!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I purchased an iPhone XS and it finally arrived. It was nice to see that is was packaged very well to prevent damage from shipping! The phone already came with a screen protector which was really convenient for me. It does have a couple of scratches, but they aren't very noticeable unless I look at it really closely. Plus, I will have a case on this phone so they can't even be seen. The battery health is at 94% which is not bad at all for a renewed phone.  The included charger is rather short, but it does its job. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot. I did not have trouble connecting this phone with my company (I purchased a fully unlocked phone) as I did with a previous vendor.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone looked great but when we put in our ATT SIM card it froze our accounts. We had to take to ATT and they said account frozen because the phone was reported lost or stolen. It ended up costing us two days of time to get account unfrozen and find a replacement phone. Huge pain!!! They said in the future if you buy a refurbished phone to take to carrier and have them look it up to<br>Check the trade in value. If the phone is lost or stolen it will be flagged as blacklisted and you know to not put in SIM card.\n</span>']"

It has held up, in pretty good condition, and works like a charm. The only downside to it is that I cannot turn my camera shutter sounds off. Everyone can hear if I’m taking a video, picture, voice recording, or screenshot for safety reasons. Other than that I am happy with my purchase. Hope that helps 😝\n</span>', '<span>\n  I have been using this iPhone8 for about a week as of 6/22/20 and it is working great on T-Mobile.  I bought one from another vendor and it too works as well. Great condition, looks new to me.  Battery life seems perfectly fine.  Audio is great, screen is great. No problems at all so I expect it will last.  Very glad I bought it.  Came with a charger and cable.  See picture\n</span>', '<span>\n  As the title says, works as well as the iPhone 7. Replaced it because I thought a problem was hardware related (turned out it wasn’t). Do like the expanded 64 GB memory over the 32 GB memory of the 7 because I can have my entire music library onboard. Use music, podcasts, calendar, all of it. Signing in to my account, the phone filled with all my apps and data. Honestly don’t notice it’s much faster with updated chip and I seldom use the camera, so newer features don’t make a significant difference to me but bottom line is is works as well as I’m used to. Will use it until I upgrade to iPhone 12 when that comes out, so I can be ready for 5G when it really it deployed and working (most places have little to no 5G, regardless of what the ads say).\n</span>', '<span>\n  This is a better iPhone than the 7S and any before it and at same time it’s not a better phone than 8S or any that have come since.<br><br>I think the renewed standard has set a high bar, one which was not met with my order. There is a visible scratch on the screen that can be seen at an arms reach. I’m not sending it back to wait phoneless for a new one, but I think it’s a valid complaint. One that is probably common in occurrence but not often acted upon.<br><br>Otherwise the screen graphics and interface is really nice, the processor doesn’t leave me wanting, and all these things are known by almost all iPhone owners. My review is about Renewed, and the difficult standard set that may offer more than what this particular  supplier is able to provide.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I got a nearly brand new phone! It is definitely 100% worth the upgrade from the 6s, nearly everything about the phone is better. It didn’t come with the headphones or a headphone jack adapter though, so make sure you get that too. This was an incredible deal being as the iPhone 8 goes for twice the price from apple.\n</span>', '<span>\n  as expected!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I love my new phone! The battery life lasts tremendously longer than my old iPhone SE. it runs smoothly, charges quickly and stays charged, and is the perfect size! I highly recommend buying this phone. I have already recommended to friends looking to get new phones. Unbeatable for what you get!<br><br>PS mine even came with a charger chord and charger wall outlet.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I ordered this phone on December 20th and it was expected to come on the 31st. To my surprise it came just two days after on December 23rd without Amazon Prime. As for the phone itself, it worked well and looked new from afar. I think there were some minor scuffs but nothing a phone case can't hide. The phone itself came with a charger though it wasn't an official apple one, still I appreciate that there was a charger. The only negative thing was that my phone is a Japanese phone so when I take photos even with the phone on silent, it still makes a shutter noise. It is an unlocked phone so take it to your provider so they can insert your sim card into it, it is a very simple process. Overall a great phone, if you can't afford to buy a new iPhone from the store, buy this one instead! I am very happy with my purchase.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was having some trouble with the sound fading out and I was going to return the phone just 2 days before the deadline to return would be up, and the seller immediately provided me with a postage paid return label.  Then I spent hours on the phone with Comcast and Apple and it was determined that the problem was not with the phone but with the cell phone service.  (I had started having the same problem with my Android phone as I have 2 phones.)<br> It is a long story but before I bought this phone I bought the same phone from the same seller because I had tried to cancel it because I had failed to get the 0% financing and failed so I returned it ad ordered it again.  had received my refund right away.  So I am happy with the phone and with the seller, BuySPRY.\n</span>']"

After I completed the set up over the phone with my carrier, I was FINALLY able to get into the settings on the phone, and I ended up checking the battery life. It’s at 73% RIGHT OFF THE BAT! Seriously?! If you’re going to sell refurbished iPhones, part of that refurbishing is replacing the battery! My daughter said to me the very next morning “The battery goes down really fast. I don’t leave anything open on it but it drains pretty fast, is that normal?” I now have to spend 49.00(estimated online price) at an Apple store, to get a new battery. FYI: You can’t check the battery life until you set up the phone, otherwise I would of checked it before setting it up, and I would of returned it. Now I’m stuck buying a new battery, on top of wasting MORE money on gas and time to drive to an Apple store some 20 miles from me. If I HAD known, I would of paid a little extra for a phone with a good battery. I WAS going to buy 3 more phones for Xmas, for my other 3 teens,but not from this seller. I’ll be buying from a different seller from now on, and it’s too bad, because I really wanted this to be a good buy. I will be asking for battery life % before buying now. I do not recommend unless you want to replace the battery right away. Not worth the money or aggravation. They did ship it in within the time frame though.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Where should I begin?  Well, let\'s start off with something positive, this iPhone 7 is a solid offering (on paper) at the current price point.  In theory, if the device delivered is in the condition listed on the product page, how can you go wrong for about $200?<br>  I hate to break it to you, but this can go VERY WRONG in a relatively short amount of time.  I\'m currently on my second renewed iPhone 7.  The first one I only had for about a month and then the screen decided to separate from the metal casing of the iPhone, so I logged into my Amazon account and processed a warranty replacement.  The warranty replacement showed up in two days time, no complaints there.<br>  I\'m currently on my 2nd device from the original purchase and then I start getting battery life notices popping up on screen, and then a few weeks later, the center of my phone display starts to form a slight curve and gets more pronounced as the week progresses.  I take my iPhone to the Genius Bar at their retail store and come to find out the battery in my iPhone has failed and is starting to bulge and expand while still in the phone.<br>  Normally I would log into my Amazon account or contact customer service and see what options are available, but of course, my warranty expired six days ago as of this review, so officially I have no warranty coverage.  When I did try to contact customer service, I talked to four different reps over the course of about an hour on the phone and finally the two options provided to me to resolve this issue was...#1: ""Contact Apple and see if they will honor their warranty"", small problem with this is that there is only a 1 year limited warranty on iPhone\'s and the one year warranty started when the first owner had this phone.  The phone is about two years old at this point I would assume, but definitely NOT covered under any warranty by the manufacturer.  But their retail stores are more than happy to take my money and repair it.  Option #2: ""We can make an exception and you can send the phone back in.  Even though you have a damaged battery, UPS will still take the package.  We even have a warning label we can provide you that you can put on the box.""  Normally I would be more than happy to go with this option, however, the local UPS store has made it abundantly clear, they will not accept a package with a damaged or potentially damaged lithium ion battery due to the fire risk.  The only way the phone could be safely shipped is with a fire resistant packaging which I don\'t have and the local UPS Store also does not have.<br>  Bottom line, I\'m stuck with a phone that has a failing battery and glitchy phone display because of the swelling battery AND I\'m also out of the money I paid for this iPhone, and I don\'t have a properly working phone.  I would suggest the following, purchase a pre-owned iPhone elsewhere or just go with another phone all together, don\'t bother purchasing an Amazon Renewed device, the quality and reliability just isn\'t there.\n</span>', '<span class=""cr-original-review-content"">\n  Lo peor que eh comprado usado en Internet.

Off the mark of the promised 90% by almost enough to be a deal breaker. But due to its pristine physical and aesthetic condition, it’s going to be a keeper. And after the last few weeks of constant use, it’s held steady at that 87%.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Overall, I\'m satisfied with my new phone. This is my first iPhone after being an Android user.

It came with a charger and super long cable, which all seemed to be in new condition. It doesn\'t come with headphones, which I knew from the description and other reviews. After having it for about 2 weeks, I\'m noticing the battery life could be better, but this may also be due to my usage and it\'s still better then my old phone. Tonight my xs died while I had it plugged in and charging. An hour later, I still couldn\'t get it to charge which scared me and made me think it was something wrong with the phone. I switched charging ports and finally started to see a charge. So don\'t put too much faith in The ""Ashley Audio and Accessories"" branded charger so as not to get stranded with a dead phone. Replace the charger with something more trustworthy.

Five months of use for $569.98????\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was skeptical about this at first, but I’m glad I bought the phone in the end. I read a lot of reviews that said the phone didn’t work or had varying things wrong with it, but I think most people go into this expecting a new phone with no damage whatsoever to the outside. However, if you read the product description carefully, it’ll tell you everything you need to know. I got lucky because there are no scratches or dents anywhere on the phone I received, but even if there had been some, I don’t think I would care. You’re paying $400 for a flagship phone, so expecting some minimal cosmetic damage is not a bad idea.<br><br>I love this phone. Face recognition works great, the screen is vibrant and I can see a stark contrast in the colors when compared to my old iPhone 7+. I was hoping to get a newer battery, but I only got 83%. However, I don’t have an issue with that, because worst case scenario, I get the battery replaced for $70 at the Apple store, and I’m still paying less for this phone than I would pay for a new Xs or other newer iPhone.<br><br>Overall, I can really only speak for buySPRY, but I really recommend buying from them. It’s a great phone, and I plan on having it for a long time.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Cosmetically the phone was okay, no major scratches. I was disappointed that there was a bunch of dirt between the aluminum lining. The speakers are clogged with dirt and the phone gets after using it a little while. The battery life is at 87% which is disappointing because my old iPhone that I am selling is at 94% which means I’m switching out great battery life for much lower battery quality even the phone I bought is newer. The tempered glass screen protect is put in crookedly which is annoying because it’s not that hard to put them on. I have 90 days so I’ll see how it goes. It also makes me nervous that I don’t know exactly what was wrong with this phone before. I’d say the price for the quality of battery life is overpriced for a used refurbished phone. Also it came with those crappy chargers you’d buy at a gas station. Probably won’t be using it because I heard if you don’t use an original apple charger it can decline the life of your phone battery.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I bought this phone mainly for work. The battery lasts throughout the workday while I'm making calls, browsing the web, and managing social media accounts.<br>I upgraded from an iPhone 7+ and the XS has a larger screen, but the phone itself is smaller and easier to use with one hand. After getting used to the lack of a home button, I've also noticed that I can do the same operations faster than before.<br>The camera quality is great, especially in portrait mode. It really accentuates the details, and the built-in editor makes it easy to quickly edit and post photos.<br>The video quality is also great for a phone. It's more than capable of shooting short films in 4k or 1080p (although it would help to have accessories).<br>Finally, I love the seamless integration of Apple products. I can easily work on a project by going back and forth between my MacBook Pro and iPhone, and when I'm on the go and don't feel like taking my phone everywhere, I can simply wear my apple watch and keep up with notifications and stay in touch with friends and family.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  You know that every device in this category is going to be individual, I’ll begin with the price it’s just high enough that you will expect a nice clean looking Device, that’s exactly what I got almost feels new generic boxing and mediocre packing materials take away from the Apple experience, who cares after 2 minutes with your nice clean new looking Apple iPhone XS loaded up with memory working like a dream , the device is fine t-mobile had no problem getting the device onto my account, all is well great purchase , Thanks To the Seller for putting such care into getting me a device that I hope will last a couple years\n</span>']"

Honestly, I'm not sure why BuySPRY has only an 85% seller rating over the past 12 months. The iPhone 8 256gb I received is in like new condition.

Will be purchasing in the future.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Had multiple problems, the seller took it back and promptly refunded my money.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was most disappointed.  They left an iPhone on my front porch!  My husband was home.  No phone or ring!  It was little enough to go in our locked mail box!  Or require a signature, or ring the bell!  Something!!  It was inboxed!  No Apple charging cord or plug!  The screen ha many little scratches and is cloudy!  Won’t but from this complaint again.  The reviews were good so I felt confident with my purchase.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This seemed to be a good deal, until I realized that I could not hear anyone on regular function.

Returned without a problem.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Had no trouble at all in the setup and phone came with 100% battery health and no scratches or cosmetic damages.

This is the upgraded refurbished phone you’d think it would have been fine or at least the support would’ve been good but the whole experience was terrible. As soon as it arrived the camera kept freezing on me then stopped working all together. Getting support was a joke. I spent over an hour total with two different support people walking me through every solution they could think of. Press this button, hold the sleep button, now try this and that and 100 other things. What a waste of time! I gave up and said can you send me a replacement and they never even acknowledge it just kept going with this and that to get it to work. I finally just submitted a return. What a headache!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  The phone looks perfect, and I bought an unlocked version and it worked perfectly with my Verizon network. Came with an aftermarket charger, But quite honestly it’ll probably last longer than an Apple charger. As long as the phone holds up this review will stay good.

I understand that I was ordering a refurbished phone but chips and large scratches on the screen are intolerable in my opinion.

Like 6 hours longer doing the same stuff.

Took some time getting used to no home screen. Occasionally the data/ wifi connection gets iffy. I still have the same plan as i did w my 6 and still the same circumstances (same home wifi, same job/ school ect) calls/ facetime will occasionally freeze/ sound fuzzy if i am not connected to wifi. That was never a problem with my 6 (my 6 was a GSM unlocked, idk if that has anything to do with it) I wear glass, and sometimes the face ID does not recognize me if i do not have them on. Battery life is great! And i like being able to access low power mode easier than having to go through settings all the time! All in all, good phone. I can tell you one thing, it is not worth $600+. The raw materials used to make iphones are worth less than $10. This was the best price i found for this phone, so thank you!!!\n</span>']"

Definitely NOT a quality item &amp; I will most definitely be returning this.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone works perfectly fine, and honestly ended up exceeding expectations.

Unfortunately seems not to be the case. Probably won't buy from this source again. I've had it for just a few days. The first day I used it, it kept shutting down at 25% battery (1 app open). On day 2, the thumbprint recognition stopped working.

Customer doesn\'t fuckkng exist so I\'m just returning and getting my money back dont buy this!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I ordered this phone fully unlocked in a desperate attempt to get a quick replacement for the one I dropped in a toilet.  After purchasing, I read the comments thoroughly and thought the phone would not be compatible with my Boostmobile network.  I even contacted the seller to alert them to my potential return.  When it arrived, I immediately took it to Boostmoble to see if it would work.  It was a success.  However I had to pay $35. Bucks.  My iPhone 6 memory card is not compatible with the iphone8.  I had to buy a compatible boostmobile SIM card.  I love my new phone.  Great quality.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Not happy about receiving a locked phone. We have tried to reach out to the seller but they have not communicated with a solution to the problem. We are very disappointed.\n</span>', '<span>\n  It’s fully functional and works just fine. I use straight talk and I haven’t really had any problems except at some point when I took calls I couldn’t hear them unless I put it on speaker but it went away and work just fine. Came with a tiny scratch on the bottom corner but I have a case on so I don’t see it. Same size as an iPhone 6 but the iPhone 6 has a louder earphone. I can hear through it but it’s not loud so that sucks but my phone works and it’s really nice. Came with a charger too. No earbuds unfortunately\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Received my iPhone within a few days of ordering it.  There is not a scratch or mark on it anywhere.  It presents as new.  Had to take it to the Sprint store to get a SIM card since the one in my old iPhone 5s wouldn't work.  They had it up and running in a matter of minutes.  Called Sprint to see if I could get the phone unlocked.  Again, in a matter of minutes they had that done.  So, now I have a perfect iPhone 8, unlocked and performing flawlessly on the Sprint system.  With it now being unlocked  I can transfer to any other CDMA carrier that I choose.  Battery capacity is 95% which is excellent.  Fingerprint reader works perfectly.  Just purchased another one of these for my wife.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I’ve been using this phone for 3 weeks. Calls are so quiet that unless you’re in silent a silent room you can’t hear the call even with the volume turned all the way up. The keyboard occasionally doesn’t pop up- you have to turn the phone off and back on to get the keyboard working, made worse by the fact that it’ll only turn on after being turned off if it’s connected to power even if it’s fully charged. And there’s an annoying feedback noise on the playback of videos made using the front facing camera.<br>So calls, text, and camera are bad. Hopefully Amazon honors the 90 day guarantee because I won’t be able to return it until next week and when I tried to return it to the seller it said that had to return it by tomorrow.\n</span>']"

I had no clue what these three blank frames were. Then it clicked I needed to place my Sim into this white frame little card. Finally I inserted my sim sitting in the white framed card into phone hurray! My network showed up front screen. I inserted SD card on top of Sim card designated slot. I do have micro card but I haven't put it on phone yet. The phone does most of the work. It transferred files from email, apps, but not photos automatic I have to download a photo app from Google and it will transfer all photos. I just sit back and wait few minutes.

Comes with a generic sync cable, nothing else is included."" To my amazement, the phone had no SIM card tray...just an empty, hollow slot where the tray should be. This is kind of a big deal! Without a SIM card tray, you cannot insert a SIM card, or activate the phone. Extremely misleading. Very scammy. I have ordered a SIM card tray from a third party, at added expense, in hopes that I can still use the phone. This has been extremely inconvenient, as I have not been able to activate, or use the phone. Now I\'m wondering if what else might not work on the phone. I would definitely NOT purchase from this seller again. It appears it came from a third party called Gatsby Electronics...the card that came with the phone had an email address to contact, with no phone number. Of course they never responded to my email. Apparently, purchasing from sellers on Amazon Marketplace is no different than purchasing from ebay. This has been a learning experience. I\'m extremely disappointed in Amazon for allowing such practices.\n</span>', '<span>\n  What a disappointment. I bought this thinking it was a good deal but turned out to be a headache. Right out of the box there was SYSTEM UI FAILURES causing me to drop calls do to the fact that the speaker and microphone would completely stop working randomly. I tied restarting multiple times, power cycling and a factory data reset all to no avail. This phone is for a primary business line as I manage my day to day business activities. This issue caused me to drop calls and was s huge inconvenient that hit me hard. Bummer!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Great phone for the week that it was working, after the it started randomly shutting down and entering boot loops. No amount of soft or hard factory resets could fix it. I soon discovered that this was a known issue with the device and that the great Google has been known to skimp on quality checks on the devices that they have manufactured by others.<br> I'm shocked that a brand new in box device would have such terrible issues.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I wanted to buy this phone, so I find in all available choices in Amazon. I wouldn\'t buy used ones and the current item is all I can try. I read through most reviews and seems it looks risky, some say item not sealed, some say it looks like used. In particular, a buyer said the phone he bought from Abe\'s Electronics Center isn\'t sealed, and this is what the seller of current item.<br><br>I was worried so I send a question to Abe\'s to confirm, and they say it is brand new. Okay I just trust them, and I\'ve prepared for the worse scenario where I have to return this item if they lied.<br><br>Fortunately they didn\'t lie, it indeed is brand new. I\'ve used this phone for a week, there is no problem about it. Except when I first upgrade to Android 8, then to 9, both version makes the phone super lag and slow. So I had to downgrade back to 7.1, but it had nothing to do with the hardware. I like the phone very much and it worth every penny.<br><br>Attached the photos I took to show case its great camera. The plant photo is taken with the ""lens blur"" feature, which gives very realistic bokeh effect. The other is taken in normal mode.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I purchased this phone new from HometownDiscounts. The phone was as advertised: New (still in original packaging with stickers and wrapped on the items in the box), the right color, and the right model. The phone was unlocked and all I had to do was pop in my SIM card to activate it. I ordered from Canada, and the US Pixel version does, in fact, work on international networks. Really pleased with the service and quality.<br><br>As for the Pixel itself, I am really happy with it so far. I am a bit of a luddite. I was still using my now almost five year old Nexus 5 up until the screen started peeling off the phone's cracked body. I like what I like and didn't want to spend $1000 on a new phone or get locked into a contract and payment plan. This was the best compromise I could think of, despite the risk of buying third party. The Pixel is surprisingly similar to the Nexus models, which I was very pleased about. I was only surprised because this was Google's entry into the luxury phone market. It retains the best parts of the Nexus phones (clean OS, practical design, etc.) while adding design improvements (great camera, fingerprint reader, better picture and sound, etc.). Overall, a great phone.<br><br>Note: There is no warranty with this phone, as others have pointed out. The only way to get a warranty is to purchase through Google or a carrier. But considering that you're paying half price for a new phone that is unlocked and that Google doesn't even carry anymore, it's worth the risk to me.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Do not buy this phone. The product is listed as being new but no, it's not new. It is used. The phone box was already opened. The instruction manuals had tears in them. The cables looked like they were previously used. The phone had some scratches on the back. The phone also had a sim card in it already. I will be returning this phone soon. Do not buy this phone.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I purchased a used Google Pixel (2016 model) in March 2019 after damaging my old phone and hoping to tide myself over until I paid all the installments on the old phone.  I\'d heard good things about the Pixel and found a used model for a good price here on Amazon.  I got the phone on time and in one piece, with an included after market charger as promised.  The phone\'s condition was described accurately - a few minor scratches on the case but no screen cracks and no apparent problems.  However, after a few days of use the problems started to appear.<br><br>The first time I tried to make a phone call on the phone, I discovered there was a serious problem.  The phone\'s microphone was not working during phone calls or at any time.  When this bug presented itself, it completely crashed the ""Phone"" app and I could not even hear the person on the other end of the line.  After some research, I found out that this was a known problem with 2016 Google Pixels.  There are some known issues where the phone will sometimes think you have a bluetooth headset paired to it when you really don\'t and just in general hardware and software issues with the microphone.  You can find these issue by simply Googling ""2016 Pixel Microphone.""  Phone calls worked just fine so long as I had a bluetooth headset paired, but if I wanted to talk directly on the phone it would only work if I restarted the phone and kept bluetooth disabled and even then it only worked about 1 out of 3 times.<br><br>Amazon asked for a few specific features to be reviewed.  The fingerprint reader worked perfectly.  It picked up my index finger without issue.  No issues with this feature.<br><br>The battery life was very poor, even for a used phone.  I could only get through about 8-9 hours away from a charger before the phone would die.  It would also unexpectedly shut off with 10-15% charge remaining.  Though, I should say it was unexpected when the phone didn\'t die until it got down below 5% because it almost always shut down somewhere between 10 and 20% charge remaining.  Even with battery saver mode permanently enabled, the phone could barely get through a work day.  Battery life is going to be hit or miss with a used device so I give it some leeway, but this Pixel\'s battery was significantly worse than any smartphone I\'ve ever had even after years of use.<br><br>Overall, the phone was a decent value for the money.  I got it at a good price here on Amazon ($100) and when it was holding a charge, the phone worked well aside from the ""Phone"" app.  I probably would have kept it in spite of its faults except that it failed to allow me to take calls from my wife a few too many times.  If you are willing to keep a bluetooth or wired headset always plugged in or simply don\'t need to make voice calls this phone will be a great value used.  If not, I wouldn\'t recommend purchasing it.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Phone 99% perfect, but the 1% was a truly significant hurdle.  Phone arrived without Sim card tray.  Didn\'t realize until went to Verizon to buy Sim card/activate phone.  Amazon Chat rep found sim tray from another seller. Once I ordered it, Amazon reimbursed cost.  Arrived 2 days later, fit perfectly, and was able to finally activate phone, so I am out no money, but it was not a good experience.<br><br>Phone itself - once activated, it\'s been perfect.  Great value for those of us who don\'t ""have"" to have the absolutely latest $1,000 phone, but want a great phone.  Fast, sleek, not loaded with bloatware, great camera.  Data transfer from old phone didn\'t work the first time, but the phone\'s transfer interface showed me that texts and pics didn\'t transfer so I ran the routine again and everything transferred.  I was worried about reviews about screen cracking easily and can see how that can happen, so I ordered a Pixel Google case at the same time ($5.90) and it seems to have enough of a lip to adequately protect the screen from most drops.  Case: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MG82ONA/ref=cfb_at_prodpg\n</span>', ""<span>\n  If I had written this review a few months after I received my Pixel, it would have been 5 stars. I loved the battery life, the photo quality, everything! I would have recommended the Pixel to anyone!<br><br>But now, only 1.5 years later, the battery life is honestly the worst of any phone I have ever had. Period. The battery drops from 100% to 90% after just 5 minutes of screentime-- draining constantly. If I try to take a picture while I am at 50% or less-- it just shuts off and auto-plummets to 0%. This makes is super unreliable.<br><br>I have read many reviews on other websites where people with a first generation pixel are struggling with the same thing. Basically ever since the 2 updates ago, the phone has been basically impossible to use without carrying a portable charger everywhere. I would not recommend this. Save your money and buy a phone that will last longer.<br><br>Note: I use it with Google's Project Fi service too, so it isn't even a carrier issue. It's clearly a battery quality issue.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I purchased the item ""Google Pixel Phone - 5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (32GB, Quite Black)"" from the seller ""GALAXY TECH LLC"" which was fulfilled by Amazon. The moment I got the phone something seemed off as the phone did not come in a sealed box. The phone came in the original box and the box was intact, but it surely had been opened and was missing the usual shrink wrapping. Moreover the sim removal tool and the USB-A to USB-C cable that is usually included in the box were missing. The phone itself looked new at initial glance (it came in the protective wrapping), but the very first time I plugged the phone in, it did not charge. I got the phone to charge after a few tries and finally realized that the phone is charging only when plugged-in in one direction. The Pixel uses USB-C which is normally bi-directional. I also tried another Pixel OEM charger that works fine with other phones, but still did not work in both directions with this phone. I have tried resetting as well as updating the phone to no avail. This looks like a refurbished piece even though this is advertised as new.\n</span>']"

The 9900 I had was beautiful with amazing build quality, and was something I just wanted to own once again. This device was NOT that.<br><br>1) The first thing I noticed was the battery. It came with a JM1 battery that was an OBVIOUS fake. It was printed on the front of the battery as 2400mAh, of which the original was 1230mAh (and the original didn't even print this on the front, making this very obvious). It was also EVER so slightly thicker, so the back door would not even close properly, and would sometimes pop open. I included a picture. Just google the JM1 battery and you will see it doesn't look the same on the front, and obviously shouldn't be 2400mAh.<br><br>2) Next I noticed that the edges of the steel frame were not perfectly lined up with the soft touch back, which means you easily felt the edges of the steel in your hand. This is an obvious sign that this phone was taken apart, put back together, and done so poorly. It wasn't much, but it was enough to be annoying.<br><br>3) After this, I then noticed it would NOT read an SD card no matter how hard I tried, and boy did I try.<br><br>4) The browser has some stupid Chinese site bookmarked and it can not be removed.<br><br>5) All the accessories in the box were OBVIOUS Chinese knockoffs, some with the Blackberry logo not even printed out correctly. I would not trust a single device with these cables/charger. The included case was a JOKE when compared to the quality Blackberry case. It was also listed as a swivel holster in the bag it was sealed in....it was actually some cheap pouch.<br><br>Considering you can pick these up in the same condition as this (maybe better) for a LOT cheaper on the used market, I simply can NOT recommend this at all. STAY CLEAR. DO NOT TRUST DLH Mobile!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Bought strictly for talk and text. Have no interest in internet access. Put in the battery and AT&amp;T sim card I had purchased separately from AT&amp;T and it works fine. Battery is adequate not great. About 80 hours standby. Physical keyboard is exactly what I wanted. Like the way it looks and feels in the hand.<br>****as of February 2021 ATT will no longer support 3G - this phone will not work on ATT****\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Works great... But has an outdated sim, app os, and the browser is painful. But using it for anything else is so satisfying. It's fun for the memories. I got it because I wanted to squeeze any life I could out of it. Should you get one for daily use... You won't be able to get much out of it.<br><br>Get a Classic if you want an old school blackberry. Or get the keyone... Only options these days.<br><br>Long live Blackberry!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  PREFACE:<br>I honestly forgot which seller this came from (sorry) but I do know it came FLAWLESS for about USD$190. It was NIB with AT&amp;T branding which was absolutely PERFECT for me (you can guess why). I have no idea if it was locked or not though, because I wanted it for AT&amp;T anyways.<br><br>HARDWARE:<br>The keys are brilliantly soft, yet very easy to type on (with my fists of meat and fingers of butter) The screen is a decent resolution too, it's sharp yet very bright in daylight. The speaker is loud and crisp in calls, but a little less quality for a/v than the Curve (who cares). The touch screen is on-par with standard devices today, and is always a neat party trick for non-blackberry people. It's also a great feeling to have the same zooming, panning, map control and etc as an Android device.<br><br>Battery life is a bit crap, it lasts all day on normal use but only just. The processor power may to blame for that. The camera is so-so, I wouldn't skin a website with photos from it like I did with my Samsung Galaxy S2. Call Quality is decent, nothing to write home about either.<br><br>SOFTWARE:<br>BB7 (Blackberry OS 7) is very intuitive and has some great features, but it's a bit unstable... and there's less apps for it than BB10. (Next phone is definitely a Q10 unless they release something better.) It's a nice-looking OS but misses a couple important marks in 2014 like Voice control, Text-to-speech, and an instant web search capability. It's definitely a great communicator though... as BlackBerry has always been, and Blackberry hasn't fallen short on that at all.<br><br>OVERALL:<br>Great overall for Blackberry 7 Devices, Not so up-to-speed on the whole smartphone world. If you have the extra cash, splurge on the Q10. You'll be rewarded with more apps, better interface, more features, and the same smooth, soft, yet rigid keyboard for typing out your important communications.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  This is an awesome phone, even in the day of touch-screen enabled, octa-core-processor-driven monster phablets. I have owned Android- and Windows phones as well as older blackberries. The reason I went back to a Blackberry was because of its enhanced security in the age of malware that has penetrated Android and iOS devices. Battery life is much better on this devices as well. In addition, the phone does not encounter crashes and random restarts like the other aforementioned devices that most people own. Sure there are not as many apps, but isn't that what tablets and PCs are for? Having a physical keyboard is a plus too, since it allows more accurate typing.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The phone has worked as well for me as I should expect in my very rural, very low-coverage-by-anybody area.  So far I have not been able to connect to BlackBerry to get updates and set up my BlackBerry ID - and therefore am not able to download any of the few apps I intended to get when purchasing the phone.  I'm not sure whether this is due to my signal power, or just the product being so antiquated that the corporation no longer has updates for it (or at all?), which would be my mistake for incomplete research.  I recently dropped it on my tile kitchen floor, and that seems to be the cause of the terrible rattle I now have in the handset speaker, though speaker phone still functions well.<br>I will had that, having once had an Android and enjoyed the Google search widget, it is sad to have to first enter Google in the web browser before continuing with my normal internet searches.  However, I did not purchase this phone to be an internet device, I purchased it primarily for talk and text and, when I have good enough signal, those functions operate just fine.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Third 9900.  Love these phones.  Since I am not a social media person or a millennial, this phone is the best for calls, e-mails and texts.  It works well in searches but I do very little searching. Keyboard is outstanding, much better than a touch screen!  It has GPS that I turn off unless I need a location.  I use Pandora and that works great!  You can keep the $660 + Samsung and Apple phones.  For my use, it is the best!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  My blackberry is have terrible network issues. I removed the sticker seller said was ok to remove and it got worst.. Now I'm on GSM or no network connection majority of the time. This has been very disappointing Update: sticker on sim doesn't affect the signal. the signal originally sucks since edge is not commonly supported with tmobiles towers.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Dear Cell Lounge Inc,<br><br>I ordered and paid for a new Blackberry 9900 - Clearly this is a used/refurbished phone and Cell Lounge is clearly a bait and switch business facilitated by Amazon.

On top of that, because no one buys Blackberrys these days, you're left with absolutely no support from carriers. I used to love Blackberrys and the fact most of them - including this model - used actual buttons instead of the annoying hard-to-use virtual buttons that seem to dominate the industry. However, because of this phone's many issues, I returned it and bought an iPhone.\n</span>""]"

Straight out of the box, it looked good. However, when I tried to activate the phone, there wasn't the necessary IMEI number in the settings. This means that the iphone was either stolen, or the internal logic board is faulty (according to google).<br><br>Additionally, the headset speaker (top one you put next to your ear when making a call) was clogged and tin-ny. The audio quality wasn't great, and I wasn't able to clean the debris out myself.<br><br>I didn't take stars off for this, but I also received a phone that was well out of the general AppleCare warranty. This means the iPhone was sold by Apple over a year ago. This is obviously expected for a refurbished iPhone, but keep this in mind that in case you have a problem with your iPhone.<br><br>EDIT: I was wrong about the missing IMEI number. The headset quality was awful, so I took off two stars for that, but I raised my rating from 1 star to 3 to reflect my mistake.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The screen quality and battery life are acceptable for a refurbished product. The battery life is currently at 89% after the first couple of months of ownership for comparison. The phone's outside was like new when received, however, internally I began to have startling issues pretty early on (unuseable three months after purchase). My phone began experiencing a reboot loop and after being unable to correct the issue through updating and restoring, I brought it to a local trusted shop that found a damaged wire connected to the face id that was causing the issue. I had it fixed for $40 but I lost two months of data since my last full backup. The technician believed that the damage was likely caused during the screen replacement as part of the refurbishment process. My face id no longer works due to this issue, but otherwise is great. Hopefully this is a rare complication and perhaps buying a warranty wouldn't have been a bad idea. Otherwise, I love the phone.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Screen is amazing. Had to have OLED. It’s the only reason I didn’t want the XR.<br>Feels premium in every way.<br>Wasn’t sure if I was going to keep it but it took about a day to know I could never give it up.<br>It came well packaged with off brand charger. But the cord is really nice considering.<br><br>Minor scuffs on metal and tiny scuff on bottom back glass. I was really really happy it was in such great condition. 89% battery.<br><br>I hate that I love apple so much now. I had a Mac as a kid and kinda forgot how beautiful their OS and build quality is. But damn the cult of Mac entry fee is intimidating. And tbh it doesn’t replace windows for everything. But I’m slowly but surely going to own the entire ecosystem. And felt like and iPhone 7 wasn’t going to cut it. I’m really grateful my bf let me buy this. I hope you experience buying a refurbished iOS device is as great as mine was!<br>Also be sure to order from an amazon endorsed seller, they give you more time to decide/be sure the device isn’t faulty.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Highly recommended.<br>It was my first purchase of a renewed cell phone from amazon and I can only tell you it was worth it. I recommend it especially to all people who do not have the budget to buy a new one.<br>I have read the most comments from seller ""BuySPRY"" and buyers to make the decision to buy<br>this cell phone. Most of the negative comments readed, in my opinion, are from very demanding people and they HAVEN\'T read the policy and / or product description.<br>The article arrived without any detail and with 92% battery life which in my opinion very good for a Renewed cell phone. Everything is working so far.\n</span>', '<span class=""cr-original-review-content"">\n  El artículo llego en buenas condiciones estéticas pero no funciona el face id y la pantalla tiene flashes y cambia de color.

My iphone 6s stopped working so i went all in and bought this, the speed this works at is crazy fast. Glass front and back so get a good case. My phone arrived with 93% battery life and a very long cord with a plug and the cord seems to be wrapped in some metal which is so nice and makes it very sturdy. The face id works so well, in the dark, the side of my face, when i'm crying and when i have glasses on. The camera is AMAZING quality it takes really good picture. the selfie camera is so good and the flash doesnt give that weird black and white fuzzy thing my old phone did when i used flash in the dark. This phone is such good quality and worth it, also when you turn the phone on its side it plays the audio out of both top and bottom making it super easy to watch Netflix or DIsney+. thanks for reading! sincerely a very happy Amazon costumer.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Phone came with 96% battery health. Phone does have some small scratches on the aluminum siding, and some scuffs on the screen. ALTHOUGH, there is no visible scratches when the screen is lit up, which is my concern. Everything works perfectly. I am extremely happy with this purchase. If you are worried that you are receiving a phone in bad quality, rest assured that the phone will arrive in almost perfect condition. I will never buy a brand new iPhone in my life again. Thank you seller for taking the time to make sure this iPhone was in almost perfect brand new condition. Any small scuffs are not noticeable and should be expected when buying a refurbished phone. The screen is perfect, the battery health is perfect, and the phone arrived a week ahead of time. I am extremely happy.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Phone is practically perfect no scratches or marks at all I was impressed HOWEVER the speaker is blown so the audio is terrible and paying $460 I can’t let it slide I’ll be returning and trying again. Also my Siri can’t hear me unless I’m actually yelling at it. UPDATE I sent the phone back and received the one i ordered (both phones came a day early) the new phone is in just as good condition AND the speaker works lol siri works a little better but thats apples problem i think so im happy it was a bit annoying to have to return the phone i dont know how they didnt check the speaker quality but i bumped it to 4 stars but well see how the return goes hopefully they get the phone and refund me. Definitely recommend buying though regardless!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I am extremely disappointed with the product. 5 months after purchase and the display is not working. I have two friends who have bought their phones from here and they were happy with it. That is why i decided to also go here to buy a new phone. However, I regret not taking the negative reviews into consideration before buying a refurbished iPhone. First off I realized soon after receiving my iPhone XS that it would heat up pretty quickly and become pretty hot. It bugged me because I spent 670 dollars after tax and I felt that after spending that amount it should have worked optimally. I regret not returning right then and there, but I brushed it off because I felt that I was being to picky and it wouldn't be a big deal. A couple months in my screen randomly went completely white. I tried rebooting it and accidentally called 911 twice. I couldn't cancel the call because the screen wasn't showing. Anyways after sometime the screen went back to normal except a very small portion in the upper left corner where the battery percentage shows was completely black. It did not affect my usage since it was a small part of the screen so I just continued on with it like that. I was just happy the phone turned on. Fast forward to now the entire screen is black. I thought my phone had died so I put it on the charger to no avail. I can tell the phone is on. Hey Siri worked but the frickin screen is black. So take heed to this review if you are thinking about purchasing. I feel frustrated and unlucky that the phone I happened to get was so janky.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Phone arrived in great condition with 97% battery capacity. Works very well. I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 I purchased back in 2015. This phone is a spectacular upgrade and works in every way I want it to.<br><br>Totally worth buying renewed over new.<br><br>I love just staring at how beautiful it is before I put a case on it.\n</span>']"

But with the 2GB RAM I didn't get any crashes - they are just a bit slower than on a premium phone. It comes with a full Android Play store and I haven't found any apps, which wouldn't download and install.<br><br>The most positive thing for me are the really good microphone and speaker, so nobody will every realize that I'm not using a premium phone, especially since the shape looks up-to-date and the color of the case is really nice.<br><br>The package contains everything I need. The phone even comes with two screen protectors (one already applied) and a soft case to protect against damage from drops. There's also a charger and a micro USB cable.

Best speed, best battery life, best camera and easiest to use.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I wanted to upgrade from my Samsung 4 Mini and I decided to take a chance and switch from Samsung to Google without spending the money on the newest model. I received a brand new unlocked Google Pixel I. The setup was very simply. I went to my local carrier store (AT&amp;T) and was in and out in 15 minutes. The setup or transfer of information from your old phone to new phone can also be done at home. The phone performs near perfectly. The only thing I noticed is it will power down once the battery reaches ~20%, but that's not a huge issue. As far as I am concerned this phone gives you 99% of what the latest I Phone and Google offer for 20% of the cost.<br><br>Update. After approximately 1 year the phone went into a boot loop and was unusable.  Based on my research reading online this is not a one-off problem with Google Phones. Buyers need to be aware that after 3 years of the release date Google will no longer repair the phone regardless of how recently you bought the phone.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Received this phone with a generic charger. The charge on the phone was near 0% and was not up to date with the latest Android software update. The owner had not done a factory reset to clear existing data on the phone. The phone would not charge no matter what. I tested the generic cable with another phone and confirmed that the cable was not the issue. THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO LEARN QUALITY CONTROL AND PLEASE FULLY TEST YOUR PHONES BEFORE SHIPPING THEM OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not buy this phone unless you want to waste time returning it.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  The price of this phone was a good value. Initially the battery life wasn't the greatest, but if you go into settings and shut off a lot of background stuff that is running, my phone can last almost 2 days. It was dying by the afternoon otherwise. So if you are having battery life issues, try playing around with some of the settings. Even though this is an older generation model, it still works perfect with the Marshmallow platform. No complaints, other than the case selection is a little slim due to the fact that it's an older model.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I am a huge fan of Google phones. This phone hardware is disappointing. What I mean by this: the Google features are easy to use, everything about the phone software is great. However I've experienced a very short battery life. I mean not even half a day if heavily used. Another issue are the glitches. When the phone is charging, the screen will just go crazy and do things on its own. The volume has stopped working all of a sudden while using Instagram. On several occasions the sound stopped working in video calls as well.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The phone came with the description scattered by the seller superficial scratches few on the screen little noticeable, but notorious, for more demanding people may not be to your liking but in my case, it's fine for a replacement phone. cons: the charger is of very poor quality, the cable does not work and caused annoyance even think that the phone did not charge but it turned out to be the cable that despite being new is of very poor quality that did not work.

Main thing: microphone would often just not work.  I tried to get it working, spent hours with Google Help, sent in the logs/bug reports.  Never figured it out.  I bought new Pixel 2 from Google, and got $133 trade-in for this Pixel, which was what I paid.  I love the Pixel 2.  If you get this phone, you might want to NOT upgrade to Android 9, at least not at first.  The phone screen looked nice, phone body had couple small blemishes, but it might have been a great phone with Android 8; I just don't know, since I didn't even try it with Android 8.  This could have just been a phone with hardware problems; but Google didn't seem to think so, since they have given me the trade-in money.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The battery drains very fast.<br>I can literally see the battery power % drop right after fully charged and unplugged from the charger.<br>It will drop like 1% per minute.<br>After using a few days, the screen started to produce some blue ink at the corner, and slowly spread to the whole screen. It took a night to spread and became fully unreadable. I cannot even transfer out my photos and apps from the phone, nor to reset the phone.<br>Very disappointed, don't buy from this store\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I received a Pixel XL, not a regular Pixel, which is a problem because the case I have obviously won't fit. That I could have maybe dealt with, but the bigger problem is it won't charge consistently (sometimes it will if the cable is in the right position...then it stops) and based on some of the wrapping I suspect this phone is refurbished, even though it says nothing about that in the description.<br><br>I know the Pixel is a good phone and I wanted another one, but this experience is just awful.

The reason for the 3-star i am giving it is because the phone failed to connect with BlackBerry Messenger chats and all other social media apps, like WhatsApp, Facebook, etc, as well as its own BlackBerry World browser. I was really disappointed because i tried everything possible, even taking it to my phone network carrier, they tried the best they can but still no headway out. I ended up getting another android phone to serve that purpose, all i do with the Blackberry now is just to receive calls and send text messages.\n</span>', '<span>\n  This phone was sold as a new unlocked phone .From the time i received this phone it appeared used the plastic cover had many scratches and the phone was sent in a piece of card stapled together with no manual remember this is supposed to be a new phone where is the box whih would have been part of the packaging of the new item .This phone was not unlocked which is the first breach of sale agreement and i had to communicate with seller to find out at least if ther was a code to unlock the phone a code was sent but the unlock process failed.My early communication i also indicated to the seller that the phone had on sms messages he indicated to me that that was done to see if the phone was working lol what a joke. When i took this phone to a cell shop with the instructions provided from the seller i was told that five calls was made on the phone one as far as Africa from the area codes seen on communicating this information i was told by the seller mthat it was impossible to know if any calls were made lol another joke they were made and also two bbm messages.I was receiving prompt communication from seller untill i indicated my intention of returning this phone . I am sure a full refund of my 288.47 is in order i was sold a product that was 1 NOT UNLOCKED 2 USED 3 DEFECTIVE\n</span>', '<span>\n  This item never worked,Sent back requested a refund never received the refund rip off\n</span>', '<span>\n  the phone was not unlocked but they accepted return\n</span>', '<span>\n  what I expected, the phone was a gift for my mom, I am delighted, thank you for sending the team quickly, a new computer, this perfect thanks, would return to buy units, is more I will record the name of the company I liked purchase, here in Venezuela that team works with any company, so if some Venezuelan reading this, I say buy with your eyes closed, I recommend\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I ordered this and did indeed receive a 9900 that works on AT&amp;T's 3G bands.  It was directly from Amazon.com and not a third party.<br><br>This is by far the best BlackBerry hardware I've ever used and I've used many of them.  The processor is very fast, the keyboard is excellent and the screen very bright and crisp.  The touchscreen is very accurate and registers touch quickly.  The major issues I have is that the battery life is not all that great for a BlackBerry but more comparable to an iPhone 3GS.  I can barely make it through a busy day with it but have bought an extra battery to solve this issue.  There are still a few other bugs that I'm sure will be worked out through the software updates like things freezing up on occasion or the camera randomly opening up.  I've had a few random reboots as well.  I still am overall very happy I made the purchase and upgraded from a 9780.  The device is very stable when I am just using the core features and the few reboots I've had have occurred while using third party apps.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  i ordered this phone from this seller cell lounge.. i ordered a new phone, i received a refurbished one with a indent on the body.. i sent it back and they sent me ANOTHER REFURBISHED one..and telling me that it is new, with bubbles on the screen... and now. everytime you lock the screen, when you unlock it, the screen remains blank and you have to restart the whole phone....i wanted to return it soo badly, but it would have cost too much to ship it back and to clear the one they would send back.... so dont buy this phone!! at least not from cell lounge!!!<br><br>update: the phone i got from them which they claimed was new, has now ceased to function.i had it for about 4 mths..it never dropped or got wet or anything.. i woke up one morning to check the time, and realized the phone wasn't responding.. tried a battery pull. and nothing.. now the phone is just a brick..i have even carried it to several techs to see if i can have it repaired but to no avail...sigh!! so now the $280 plus dollars i spent is jus a waste now!!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Im disappointed that, my device is unable to allow me to access any DATA services; I bought this device as a gift for my sister who resides in Guyana South America and had it connected to the DIGICEL GUYANA network but all that we are allowed to do is make voice calls and send text sms (text).<br><br>The tech support at Digicel GUYANA did look at the issue and advised that the device has an issue , maybe with the IMEI being blocked or something of this nature. All of the network's settings were checked and verified. Other active SIMs were tried with the same result.<br><br>I had to return to the USA with this device but since the problem was discovered I have been unable to make contact with GOODGUYS electronics which sold this device. I would love to have this issue resolved.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  When I first got this phone I was quite happy, but it only lasted for 6 months. I hate the fact I bought such an expensive smart phone so it could die without a warning. After 4 months of not an intense use, I started to get a low battery signal even after I have left the phone charging all night. I bought a new battery and 3 weeks later the problem reoccurred, then I bought another battery (this time at a store not Amazon), and again 3 weeks later the battery seemed it wanted to die. Few days later my battery was completely charged (used my colleague's Blackberry to charge my battery) and the phone just wouldn't turn on. Again, changed battery and the phone just wouldn't turn on. I took it to a store and explained what happened and the person over the counter told me that the 9900 series has this electrical problem-- just dies. It does seem correct to have an expensive phone that has such a problem to be put on the market. It is too expensive to last only 6 months. I feel cheated!  I have tried to return it, but came across the 30 days policy. But this is a fabrication defect...\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  So firstly about the product. This blackberry is so much fun to use, great OS and friendly interface. Of course the blackberry trademark qwerty keyboard and trackball are the usp. Cons are the touchscreen and the battery. I was fully aware of the limited battery life, but since its compensated for by the slim size, I feel its a decent tradeoff. Just need to remember to charge it pretty regularly and have bought a couple of extra chargers to keep at all places at all times. The touchscreen is not very intuitive and a little difficult to use if you have big fingers and of course doesn't compare to the apple experience, but the awesome trackpad helps out a lot. All in all a great device and I received it exactly as advertised by Worldwide Distributors. Its an unlocked AT&amp;T phone which I received and if you are a t-mobile user you will not be able to use 3G. In case you are buying this, it would help if you contact the seller and ask them for the specific one (tmob/atnt) that you want. For me AT&amp;T works just fine, guess I got lucky because I had not intimated the seller during my purchase. 5 stars for the bb 9900 \\m/\n</span>""]"

Overall the phone works great, came with a battery health of 87% which it still is, and is way better and long lasting than my 6s I upgraded from. There were no dents or scratches only some really minor glue spots around the back camera and some dirt in the crevices. This was a great upgrade and I would purchase from here again because the quality is good and the price is right!<br>EDIT!!! the phone got stuck in a bootloop right after the warranty ended and ended up being hardware failure. The seller would not accept a return even though the phone was broken because it was after warranty and I was finally able to contact amazon support and issue a refund. I was hopeful at first but ended up being a waste of time and money and would not purchase again. Be wary.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I am LIVID!!!  I got this phone last week and since I don't know too much about it I thought the sound and everything that was occurring with it was due to someone else's phone or it was isolated.  I can barely use it because I can't hear anyone. Also, the touch screen is horrible and don't even mention the face recognition. It is rare that I have problems with Amazon products, but this was definitely my biggest purchase and by far the worst.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone doesn’t work properly. It cuts on and off randomly also call drops and that’s not even the worst of it the phone no is unusable because of a error code that reads: cellular data cannot updated. So I can’t make calls or receive text but the sim works perfectly fine on my older device iPhone 7 Plus. I’m returning the phone just pay more to get it from Apple or a carrier. Do not use amazon. Update I wrote this review 3weeks ago and still haven’t received a refund stay away shady company.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I got the gold colored one and as it turns out the gold phone that was shipped to me was a knockoff with issues, the volume doesn’t even work, I’m very unhappy with getting a fake iPhone when I spent so much money for it, I wouldn’t buy this unless you want to risk getting a fake for way too much money\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was really hesitant to buy a phone online, but I have been very happy with the phone so far. The phone shipped quickly (like 2 days) and came with accessories I wasn’t expecting. A charger and a screen protector were included with the phone! There was a small chip on the bottom left corner of the phone, but a case will cover it up so it’s not a big deal to me. Other than that, the phone looked brand new! According to the box, the battery capacity was 90%, but when I opened the phone it was only 88%. I wish the battery capacity was a little higher, but the phone is in such nice condition that it’s not a real problem. Overall, I would say the purchase was worth the risk!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I got a defective product. would stay on less than 5 mins. could not trade for new. return was a hassle and i had to pay 10$. eventually got my money. if product worked i would have been happy. sounds like some people got working products.\n</span>']"

The build is good, the design is absolutely beautiful! It feels good in my hand and is solid. It's not bulky like the other phones. It's semi-long and slender. I haven't experienced any lag. Picture quality is great so far although I haven't tested in low lights. I love the on body feature because it keeps me from having to put my pin in over and over again when the screen locks. I love that have a LED notification light. The battery life is great also. Mine lasted all day with calls and moderate video . I even took some pictures and still had lots of battery left. Someone complained about the phone getting hot. Mine only got hot when I turned on the GPS. other than that, it stays cool. The only thing I can say is they need to make a screen protector to fit but I cut a universal one to fit. I can't express how much I love this phone!! My last phone was a BLU R2. I did not like it so glad I gave this phone a chance. I highly recommend it!\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  excellent product for the money!  came with oreo os.  works great.  display is excellent (surprisingly good!)  cameras are OK.  no complaints at all.  I've had the phone for one month.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I've had this phone for 1 month &amp; it's charger port has been messed up since day one!! I thought i got a faulty charger but i have bought 3 new chargers and none of them work! I have to hold the original charger in just a certain way just for it to charge. In 4 1/2 hours it went up 2%!! I WASTED $150!! I bought another one as well for my mom, she has no problems out of hers. I bought the sapphire and red. Extremely mad! Phone has been unuseable for two weeks now! 😡😡🙄\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I absolutely despise this phone. It\'s Google based so nothing works in ways I\'m used to or that are intuitive. I had to download apps just to open a word document. The lag in operations is something out of 2001.  When you press the button to see all open apps/programs so you can select one or close one or lags before the x appears so you can close one. The phone comes with a ""case"" that\'s more like a condom. The back glass shattered within the first 2 days. I suppose this is because they want to be safe when screwing someone on their purchase. The pictures are separated in ways that are annoying. There are almost no real cases for this phone available to purchase. The G3 accessories don\'t fit even though it is marked as such on the back label. You can\'t screen shot you can only screen video record. Everything takes extra clicks or steps and lags. THIS IS FROM A CONSUMER WHO ALWAYS BUYS THE CHEAPEST SMART PHONE I CAN GET AT T MOBILE. I chose to try to get a better phone at roughly the Same $150 price tag. Now after about a month I need to re purchase a phone that can process data as fast as a human 🙄. Never have I ever been so disappointed in a purchase in my life!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Everything works just great.  Easy to setup without any problems.  Works fine with Consumer Cellular (AT&amp;T system).  I wasn't sure of the face recognition or if it really worked.  It comes with a caution that using finerprint was probably safer anyway.  Anyway, I recomment this phone.  Took it on vacation to the UK and Ireland and it took great pics.  I also got a rubber case for it from Amazon as well.  Works fine, dropped it once on garage cement and not even a scratch.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The first two weeks was normal as with any phone, now it will drop your call while you are talking or will not let you hear what the person on the other line is saying. Playing a game, it will go back to home page or go black. Sometime, I can hear the other person but they can't hear me. Another problem is the in and out shakey voice sound. I either have to call the person back or the person has to call me back, it can take as many as two to three trays to understand what is being said.<br>The phone is beautiful but, not functional at times when needed. I am handicapped and a phone is my link to what is needed on the outside world. I'm sorry to say that I am going to have to get another phone. I wish that this one is just a lemon but I can't afford to get another one from you, to find out that it does the same thing.<br>Thank you.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  For the price you cant beat this phone, my only issue  was when i received my Phone it was defective ( mic didn't work) Amazon sent another one and it works just fine, Battery life is good  the speakers are not the loudest but  will do  for the price. It looks very nice and would not hesitate to buy another one\n</span>""]"

I even dropped the phone once on a hard floor, and it was fine. When you put the SIM card in, it is normal for it to speak to you in its own language (in my case, French)- this is not the phone\'s ""fault"", it\'s programmed into the card- you can indeed change the language. Some people complained about the difficulty opening the back cover and also inserting a SIM card- to me neither was really a problem. To pop the back case off, I just used my two thumb nails to pry it open... you could probably use a letter opener or something like that, if your fingers are too big. To put the case back on, do remember to put in the two little bottom prongs first, or it will snap into place without being all the way on. For the SIM card, it was indeed helpful to have small fingers to place it in its slot... I guess you could use tweezers, if needed. Also remember that the bottom slot is like a drawer which you need to pull out in order to put in the SIM card. It did take me a little while to get used to the phone and to figure out what the symbols meant; like some people said, the directions aren\'t too helpful- but honestly it was pretty self-explanatory, especially if you\'re used to non-Smartphones (like me!).

Still though, properly charged the phone brings me through the day with recharging only required towards the evening.\n</span>', '<span>\n  i am a geek by nature android windows ios i have tried them all and love them all. this phone is very simple to operate so it is user friendly and very powerful i get any where from sixty to a hundred emails everyday and this phone is able to handle it battery will last for ten hours which is good for the amount of usage it gets . Will send a next update once i have used it for a month.\n</span>', '<span>\n  On March 12,2013 after trying to order 2 BlackBerry Bold 9900 Unlocked Phones I ran into some problems with Hendin Tech, my first order was lost by FedEx which Hendin Tech reported that they would re-ship me two more phones asap. I never received them and after contacting customer service via email, I received a phone call from the shipping manager stating he will look into the matter.<br><br>I received an email from the ""Owner"" of Hendin Tech apologizing for the inconvenience of this incident, after another week past and no order was received I requested a full refund.  After their investigation it turned out not to be Hendin Tech\'s fault at all but, it was ""Custom Agent"".<br><br>This by far was the best customer service I have ever received from any company with the communication being timely and clear. I will do business with Hendin Tech in the near future.<br><br>D. Gilbert\n</span>', ""<span>\n  It seems that there are many posable outcomes when buying from this seller, because i checked the reviews before buying and found many more positive than negative but i have to say, this phone did NOT deliver.  It was not 4G capable, which apparently is a quality of factory unlocked phones however this was not explained and was a big let down. secondly the battery literally lasted for 23 min, i'm not sure why because since it was new one would think that it would function as well as any other blackberry but it would over heat and then die literally in 23 min.<br>lastly and most importantly, it did not ever find a network connection, with T-Mobil or AT&amp;T, it was not branded but the start up screen was some company i had never heard of.  all in all, my experience was terrible and all i can hope is that they let me return it for a full refund.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  It works great!  The seller assured me that it's new, even though the packaging would imply otherwise.  Did my research and there are ways to tell.  The phone is brand new.  Or BARELY used.  Maybe 3 minutes of talk time and 10 mb of data.  That works for me.  It could get that much in factory testing.  We use T-mobile and are very happy with it.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  None of the major carriers will accept this phone. It is not compatible, which is a shame because I loved this model.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I bought this item and brought it back to Jamaica to use. The first time I took it from the box most things were OK. I think the package was missing the travelling case and memory card but I overlooked those issues. Got the phone to charge overnight and used it the next day, but when the battery needed to charge again the phone shut down and wouldn't reboot. It wasn't charging and even putting a charged battery in it wasn't doing any good so I opted to return the phone. The cost of shipping was about 50% of the value of the phone so I'm just holding on to a $200 paperweight... Wish I had a better experience to share with you!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The seller was fast and the product was as described new in box.<br><br>This phone was ordered for some testing of features to resolve an issue we are having with yahoo and exchange (activesync).<br><br>The problem we are having is the Blackberry will not setup email accounts as expected. We tested putting in a SIM from T-Mobile and were not able to set up email at all. After spending over 3 hours in the store with T-Mobile their answer was after calling RIM it is a bad phone. We the put in an AT&amp;T SIM and got mail service to appear and setup but not the web based services only BES. Some of that may be because the prepaid services do not offer data for smartphones.<br><br>As a whole I am completely underwhelmed by the BlackBerry Bold 9900 Unlocked and its lack to work as it should.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Phone lasted a little over a month then the battery couldn't hold a charge.

But I was pleasently surprised when the phone arrived. It works AWESOME! The camera, life battery, face recogntion, everything!! The only thing are some scratches on the back, that are bearly noticeable. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BUYER, and will keep posting updates if something happens!\n</span>', '<span>\n  Received the phone and there is a problem. It immediately opens random apps constantly. I put in for a return and Amazon says it may be 2 weeks after they receive the phone before I’ll get my refund.  Extra frustrating  because this was for my son who has been saving a couple of years to buy it. I’ll help him out in getting another and wait in the refund. If they are prompt I might have to start writing a little.\n</span>', '<span>\n  It is a good phone for the price, like people have mentioned it comes in a generic box, which to me doesn’t matter, since it bought the phone and not the box. It did come with a few minor scuff, I mean to the point were you can barely notice them and if you have a case you will never see them. It does have a small scratch on the back glass which you can only see in the right light and hold the phone just right, and again you cant see it if you have a case. It did come with a screen protector which is a nice touch. Other than that, everything works and looks great. For $400 you really cant beat it. Im giving it 4 stars because of the small light scuff marks. Other than that I would definitely buy the phone again if I had to.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I upgraded to an ads from and iPhone 5 so my appreciation of the upgrade may be more than others, but I can’t be happier with this phone. The battery is long lasting, even when I’m using google maps all day, the screen came in amazing condition and the body of the phone has some scuffs but hard to see in the wrong light. If you’re planning to put the phone in a case the the minor stuff won’t matter. Great phone, works like new, and saved me about $300.\n</span>', '<span>\n  So far I am impressed. I got my iPhone delivered 3 days earlier than expected and it even came with a screen protector already on it. It Did not come with any apple box, ear buds or anything related to apple, like the instructions or charging cable, but i knew that before purchasing the iPhone. The back side of the phone has a good amount of scratches, but they are all pretty small and only visible when light it shining directly at it. Also there is a small scratch on the screen about an inch below the notch, but agin only visible when exposed to brighter light. Battery health is at 100% too. Got the phone up and running in about 30-40 min after just doing a small update to the newest version 13.4.1 (it was at like 13.2.3 or something), and adding my iTunes information. By the way I bought the iPhone XS 64GB Space Grey.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Sold as a genuine refurbished product. Cheap re-sale. Purchased for Christmas, and iPHONE Xs wasn’t working from day 1. Since Apple was not involved in this phone, cannot purchase Apple Care. BAD PRODUCT, BEWARE!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  Bought from seller Re-Com. Came in original box, with headphones and charger. However, the phone was cracked up at the top of the screen. The battery was also NOT an Apple genuine which can cause problems with the phone. I will be returning this product.<br>Also, the speaker sounds as though this phone was submerged in water. I can’t hear out of it very well as it is muffled and distorted. Save yourself the hassle and buy the phone elsewhere. Apple has refurbished XS’s for 699. I wish I would have just bought mine from there.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I had qualms about ordering this after reading a few of the negative reviews, but went ahead in consideration of the generous return policy. The package arrivedin three days, to my surprise, and turned out to be in perfect operational order. It did have a very small scuff mark on the back, which is pf no concern. I did find that I am in the camp that prefers touch ID, but face ID works as it should. Overall. A spectacular purchase for a spendid price. I have reason at all to want an iPhone 11 at twice the price.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Bought this phone as a replacement for my wife as she had broken hers.<br>When we powered it up and sync her info from her old phone the began to have problems with powering down on its own and restarting. It’s was random and then it became every two minutes it would turn off and cycle itself back on.<br>This is crazy and we had to purchase a new phone and return the one purchased here with amazon.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Amazing phone- battery life is 100%, everything works perfect, and the outside of the phone looks brand new! So easy to switch from my iPhone 6s Plus to this iPhone XS by switching my SIM cards and logging in with my Apple ID. Thank you for such a great purchase- 2nd renewed by Amazon phone that I’ve purchased and both have been well worth it!!\n</span>']"

Battery does not last as long as I thought but then he is on it for hours at a time.<br>Updated June 15, 2020.<br>Stopped charging, very poorly made. Did not last a year. Not made to last. Stopped charging and glass screen pulled off in middle you can see the light on the inside of the phone. Would not recommend this phone for a young person who is going to play games on it and actually USE it.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I bought all new phones for the family. I am so impressed with nuu brand product but mostly their customer service is over the top of the line. Delivery was 24 hrs. WOW!! I wish I would have went with nuu for myself as well. Price is awesome and quality is better then a $300 dollar brand I got. Well you all have won my vote. #1 in over all satisfaction\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This was the worst experience I've had with a purchase of a phone on Amazon.  The first phone I ordered never got here.  Fortunately they were able to send me a replacement phone.  When I got my replacement, it started off great!  I put my SIM card in and the phone turned on.  Set up was simple and I was so excited about my new phone!  Day 2:  Phone started up great and was working well until I got a DUO call.  All of a sudden, I could hear the conversation, but no one could hear me!.  I turned the phone off, turned it back on, no luck.  I went into the settings to see if an app was the reason for no one being able to hear me, no such luck!  So it seems that the speakers just went out!  Never again will I purchase a phone from NUU.  I'll stick with my Honor phones from Huawei.  I've never had a problem with their phones!  And the return process was okay until it took 3 weeks to receive my refund!  This purchase was a terrible experience all the way around.  I wouldn't recommend this phone to my worst enemy!!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone was great for about a month or so and during the second month I started having issues. I noticed only one part of the speaker was working and would crackle every once in a while. There is a battery saving mode that you can not disable and would turn on at 20%, this disables your wifi and if you are not paying attention you will go above your data limit if you are not on unlimited like I am. I recommend buying a different phone. The battery life is alright but nothing too impressive as mine would reach 20% after 10 hours of using my phone throughout a day.<br>Oct 13 2020, phone finally gave out. Was not built to last.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  To be brief, it's a good phone! I bought this phone for the intention of it being my daily driver. This phone works well with my carrier being T-Mobile and it receives calls and texts just fine. My only major issue with the phone, is the call quality. Every person I've called has said that they can hear themselves, almost like an echo is going on, that's about it. I have no idea how to fix it, but I just use my Galaxy buds with the phone to call people and it works way better. Don't be expecting to be playing 60fps high graphics COD mobile with this phone, because it is just not strong enough, although light games like Clash Royale or brawl stars work fine. The speaker, has much more to be desired, it's just quiet, but it suffices! Overall! Definitely worth the 150 dollars! My favorite feature of the phone is how it comes with NFC payment, especially at this price!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  That being said, screen coating starts wearing off after 3 months of use.  I can see my thumb area on screen.  Much like you see your travel on a laptop track pad after awhile.  So put a screen protector on phone from the start.  Like just about everything about this phone.  Charges fast, all day battery.  Feels good in hand and basically quick.  Sometimes lags, but you get use to it.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Beautiful phone!!! Didn't get service at home all the time. People would call and it would go straight to voicemail. Missed half my calls. I live in L.A county in CA by the mountains BUT no other phone has ever missed a call. I wonder if it was a phone defect?

Yes.<br><br>I'm an Iphone user and Android user mostly, but if you have to have a Blackberry, this is a very nice device. It does do 3G on AT&amp;T, it is snappy, the hardware feels very solid and quality-constructed.  The screen is very high quality and the touch functionality works nicely.<br><br>To me, the differentiating factor of a Blackberry (at least with their current OS) is that it has a full keyboard.  If you are an email maven and don't spend much time on the internet, this is a quality device for that. On the contrary, this device does a very good job of integrating Twitter and Facebook into the factory-ready experience.  A little 'net, and a lot of email productivity.<br><br>Yes, iPhone and Android have more apps. If you need a full spectrum experience, you've probably already considered iPhone or an Android. That being said, if you strongly prefer a full keyboard or must use Blackberry, this is a very nice device.<br><br>The battery life is great, too!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I received the phone with no cover for the back!!\n</span>']"

But, unfortunately, with the flaws I am not willing to overlook.<br>First, it does not connect to AT&amp;T 4G LTE Network on the east coast. All correct APN information was entered by AT&amp;T office and it only connects to 3G system. The internet speeds are slow. Sometimes the incoming phone calls and sms messages do not go through for no apparent reason with good showing signal. There is a delay between 30-60 seconds when the phone switches from WIFI mode to 3G AT&amp;T Network. It reboots itself and you just have to wait until it connects back. If you turn the phone off, it takes 2-3 minutes for the phone to turn back on after you press the button. In my opinion, it is not a reliable equipment for me where I live.<br>Like it says in the description, it is an international version. It is not specifically made for US. It might work better in other countries.<br>I returned the phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  \xa0First of all, I had read all the negative reviews of the phone before I purchased. And someone complained that it only supports 3G data. I had set my mobile carrier APN, it could run4G data, but this phone does not pre-set APN, I must say that setting the APN correctly is not easy to everyone. I uploaded a video includes how to set the APN on this phone.<br><br>I uploaded a video includes open box of the phone. Frankly, the phone is amazing. Compared with OTHER smart phones it is NOT BAD, such as big screen and lightweight. The back is plastic with gradual blue, and the color shine and vivid. The mobile phones already installed protector case and pre-install plastic screen protector. The phone has a typc-c charging port to allow fast charging. I have used it for a few days. I only normal use it watching videos and other app. The phone runs smoothly and no any problem. The battery takes at least three days if normal using. The weight of 6.4 inch screen size mobile phone is very light. The Phone speaker is loudly, I remember some negative review complain that. The system is Android 9.0 and 4GB RAM+64GB Memory, and it could be expanded to 128G. Otherwise, you can use dual SIM cards. The phone also has popular feature such as fingerprint locker and facial recognition system, even has four cameras heads. So far I am very satisfied with this mobile phone.<br><br>Pros:<br>-Big screen (compared with iphone 11 and huawei mate 10pro), I uploaded the picture.<br>-Lightweight<br>-Fast charging<br>-battery last long time(I watch a half and hour online movie and only decreasing 10% power)<br>-Four cameras head<br>-With fingerprint recognition and face recognition<br>-Affordable price<br>-4G RAM runs smoothly<br>-Dual SIM slots(one of slot could as a expandable SD)<br>-Clean Android 9.0 systems<br>-Included the mobile phones protector case<br><br>So far so good, I only found the screen resolution is 720×1560. But I cannot complain that, because most online video as 720p default, I use iphone 11 watch online video same result as this phone. I give it five stars review. If I found any other cons, I will update ASAP.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I got this phone for my 13 year old son who is in 8th grade and it’s good quality for the price of $150. It’s very nice because it has many ways to unlock the phone. The phone is very smart and has Face ID to unlock the phone, a fingerprint scanner and multiple other ways instead of just a normal number pin. The camera quality is very good, it comes with 4 cameras in a row, and the pictures are very clear and easy to see. The phone runs apps very smoothly without much trouble. It’s battery last very long and my son can use it through the whole day without it dying. The earplugs that come with the phone have good sound quality. Also it comes with 2 screen protecters and a nice clean phone case that is good for protecting the phone. The color is very nice, it’s my sons favorite color. Overall this phone is a good phone for kids if their parents don’t want to spend too much money on an iPhone.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I love my Blackview phone, it has a very good camera and resolution, that's why I chose this price range of 150.<br>My pictures look good with 13MP quad rear camera, rear main lens that has three sub lens that<br>can enhance pictures with clarity and delicacy/smoothness.<br>The front camera is 8MP which is enough and basic.<br><br>The cellphone display is simplistic and perfect.<br>The waterdrop screen is 6.49 inches and gave the High Definition look, good enough for me,<br>does not cause headache, smooth, fluent.<br>The processor MediaTek Helio P25 gives flawless graphic for watching videos.<br><br>OS is Android 9 and I like it better than Android 10. As most cell phones in the past years, it has face<br>and fingerprint technology. The RAM is 4GB, standard, so it can be not enough to do many things at the same time, but I just use it for basic phone, not for gaming.<br>ROM is 64 GB, extendable to 128 GB.<br><br>The battery life is good.<br>I put it in the fridge for 10 minutes during very extreme hot weather, don't wanna lose it.<br>The battery is big, as said 4680mAh, so I am not too worried that it will burn easily.<br>After fully charging it, it lasts for a few days<br>Also my friend said about phone should be fastly charged, it fully charges in 140 minutes.<br><br>I have not tried to use google map/<br>Hopefully it will do the job like other phones.<br><br>Like usual, it came with a charger of 5V/2A, a USB cable, type-C, with also included the protective film and phone case.<br>It has 1 year warranty.<br>Blackview A80 Pro is a good phone for the price\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This phone is a great product, especially for its price! This is the first time I have ever purchased a phone online, and I am very pleased with it. From the wellness options such as those designed to help improve sleep to good photographs and bass boosted sound, this phone is a great option for anyone looking for a well priced, great functioning phone.<br>If there was one thing that took a little getting used to, it was that as a US based purchaser, who had up to this point only purchased phones from phone carriers in US stores, the order of the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen on this phone is the view open apps button, home button, and back button which is reversed compared to most US based Androids with a navigation bar order of the back button, home button, and view open apps button.\n</span>', '<span>\n  A Very good phone for the money, it has a great camera comprising of 4 Sony lenses.

I contacted the seller and they were gracious, kind and helpful. Eventually, of course, I figured it out but I want to commend the company on their terrific support! And, it really is a great product, especially for the price!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  \xa0I really love this 4G smartphone it would do everything I need it to do,phone runs fast and smooth too.I like the feel of touch screen and the camera is amazing for the price.The large screen is perfect for me to watch Tv and the reviews for the battery is right,it can run for a long time.The value of these phone is hard to beat by any other company.This is a fabulous buy!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I have to say that I was a bit reluctant to get this phone because I typically stick to recognized brands when it comes to selecting phones.  This phone has exceeded my expectations and is definitely and upgrade from my LG phone.  I wanted a phone with 64GB at an affordable price and this Blackview A80 Pro came with unexpected bells and whistles that I did not get with my old phone.  I have Metro by T-Mobile and when I took it into the store the attendant wasn't sure that the transfer would be successful but I kept my fingers crossed and everything went well.  The attendant at the store made a comment about the phone being a really nice one. If you're looking to not break the bank and looking for lots of storage for your apps and memory space, look no further!!!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Because it’s available globally, APN has to be added manually if you are using MVNO service other than those 4 major brands. But once it’s set up correctly it works great. Moving from WiFi to data, sometimes there’s delay n you’ll need to reboot to get it working. Good value for the price, just wish they have dual sim slots + Micro Card instead of one + one hybrid. No NFC.\n</span>']"

I've had it for almost two months, and have found that the phone has slowed down and the battery life decreased greatly with use. The screen cracked after one fall, which I s'pose is to be expected, but hasn't been my experience with other phones--perhaps this is less reinforced or the screen glass weaker somehow.

SM-G892U or SM-G892T for example are T-Mobile.  Educate yourself before purchase. They should interchange, but will have the carrier\'s default software and you MIGHT have to call to have it ""unlocked""... to move to another carrier... its free (in my area) or you can swing by a store. My last phone was T-Mobile, and would still do the T-mobile updates and had locked in Apps for T-mobile... even when on AT&amp;T service.<br>And there\'s other versions of the galaxy... some are interchangeable between carriers, some are NOT (for example, sprint doesn\'t use the same tech/sim card).

There were a few apps that updated and needed some things tweaked to match settings on old phone... but it was LARGELY a flawless transfer done in one evening watching TV.<br>CONS: This phone didn\'t come in samsung packaging, didn\'t have samsung fast charger with it (random non-quick charger and cord), didn\'t have instruction manual. Shipped at 4% battery. None of this really matters to me. Quick charge would be nice... but I\'ve already got 2.<br>The phone itself is kind of heavy... but I feel that way every time I upgrade... the phones are just plain bigger. The weight of it makes me glad I ordered a tough/rubber case for it.<br>Fingerprint scanner on the back is really nice any time you\'ll be holding the phone, but have to use another option if leaving flat on a desk (or wireless charger).<br>Bixby is annoying (maybe I\'d get accustomed to it... does seem to have some nice features once setup)... but I wish you didn\'t have to agree to its terms just to open the app in order to disable that hyper sensitive side button.

But to be fair I didn’t notice it until I put a case on it and it looked like a bubble in the case but I realized it was the glass.

Next, There was no sound from the phone at all- no ringtone, no videos nothing.Next, went the vibrations so I had no way of getting notified for a text or call. Then, I could not watch videos they would load and then screen went black. Finally, the wifi has a slash through it like wifi is not available and I have to restart it to fix it. I tried everything to troubleshoot. Not worth the purchase and time wasted.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was skeptical about buying this phone I was concerned and worried about how it would arrive.

The battery life is at 82% not what I like but it’s great for a used phone and hopefully this doesn’t mess up anything with my carrier but it works great makes phones I can send text so I’ll see how it does sorry I can’t add photos because I writing this review on the iPhone XS I just baught\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was worried that I was going to get an iPhone with scratches. Not the case at all. The phone looks like new.

I was so excited to receive this phone, first phone I’ve bought in years, and when it showed it was destroyed. I’m not talking about a little crack in the screen I mean the entire phone was shattered. I highly recommend reconsidering a different option for purchasing a new phone. Just terrible.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I bought this iPhone because I have bought other refurbished products on amazon and I never had an issue with them. As I was reading some reviews it seem like most people didn’t have an issue with it either. However it came with a horrible scrap on the back glass. I know they said the product might have minimal scratches. But this is not minimal! I think it’s ridiculous. I didn’t come with protective plastic or anything either. I am seriously disappointed and I am definitely returning it. I was expecting so much more for the price.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Phone was NOT unlocked and was reported. My phone services said they couldn’t activate it. So mad I’m returning it......so DISAPPOINTED!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I was a little hesitant about buying this phone off Amazon ,reconditioned too.

For $300, this a really a great phone if you're not into gaming or someone who's looking for a top of the line camera. The camera is not as bad as some are making it out to be. In short, it's average, not great.<br><br>There's also no NFC, but I didn't care about that. I had the LG G3, V10 and V20, which had NFC and I never used it. The 6.2 inch display is the main reason I wanted this phone.The back of the phone is plastic, glossy and a fingerprint magnet. Putting a case on solves this issue. If you know what you were buying before hand, I don't see the need to list any cons, so here are the pros.<br><br>1. The display. Though not OLED, the screen gets the job done and looks really good at max brightness. I had no problem seeing the screen in direct sunlight if the brightness was 80% or more.<br><br>2. Head phone jack. This is a must have for me and the sound isn't half bad. It's not on the same level at the G6, V30 or G7 Thin Q, but it has DTS:X 3D Surround Sound, and to be honest, it sounds really good.<br><br>3. LED indicator. This was missing on my V10 &amp; V20 and didn't realize how much I missed this. You'll need to go into each application and turn on LED notifications for the apps you wish to do so.<br><br>4. Battery life. With medium usage I get a full 2 days and can sometimes have about 15 percent left on the 3rd day before charging. With heavy usage I get a little over a day. Not bad at all.<br><br>5. Orea 8.1. I was shocked to see that this phone has very little bloatware compared to other LG devices. I only had to disable 5 apps. The interface is clean and fluid. I've had zero issues having multiple apps open at once. Bluetooth, wireless and GPS all work fine.<br><br>6. The finger print scanner is accurate and works well when using a case.<br><br>7. SD card slot. This too is a must have for me. I popped in a Sandisk 256 SD card and it works as it should.<br><br>Overall, this is a great phone for those who don't require top of the line specs. I'm done paying $600-$800 for phones. I'm using this with AT&amp;T prepaid and the call quality is good. I have no problems with calls dropping either.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Very upset we purchased this phone for a gift for my daughter and it did not work.  It says the phone is unlocked but that is Not true.  This phone is a Boost mobile phone  and can only be used on the Sprint network.  Also phone number listed as a contact for help has been disconnected and no one will return my email.\n</span>', '<span>\n  UPDATE: I\'ve never had a cellphone DIE on me before!!! This cellphone was purchased new and it\'s only been 6 months!!! I noticed my phone was frozen and I couldn\'t get it unfrozen, so I did a soft reboot (volume down &amp; power button) and it finally turned off. Then, it wouldn\'t turn back on. I kept trying soft reboot and hard reboot (both volume buttons &amp; power button) and it would vibrate, but not turn on. It kept vibrating every few minutes, but the screen was still black. I waited for the power to drain and plugged in the charger, but small dialogue on the screen appeared with ""rboot"" at the top. I had to buy a new phone and stuck with the LG Stylo 4 because of my different cases I recently bought. I just hope the new one doesn\'t die as well. The only good news is that my cellphone is still under warranty, so I\'m mailing it in. It should take a couple to a few weeks. I\'m just expecting a refurbished one back that I might sell on eBay.<br><br>ORIGINAL REVIEW: I wanted an upgrade from my LG Stylo 2 and am very glad I picked the LG Stylo 4. It\'s affordable and a great cellphone for the price. My nano SIM card worked right away after insertion. I\'m glad I figured out there is a 2GB version and a 3GB version. I made sure I bought the 3GB version from NextGenOutlet since storage space was an issue with the LG Stylo 2. I also love the brightness of the screen. I use it at 50%. Comes with a fast charger. Arrived in a factory-sealed black box.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Wrongly advertised by seller. Phone only has 2GB of RAM. Secondly, phone was not unlocked properly! I am unable to enter APN information for my country because the phone was not unlocked properly. Very disappointed with this purchase!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Good: Headphone Jack, MicroSD Card expansion and the Bluetooth is surprisingly good.  I used to have a few Samsung devices (Note 2, S6, S8) and in very crowded places, my Bluetooth headset would drop audio and cut back in.  I regularly traverse Times Square in New York, and I would just not try to listen to music through that area.  This one, I've seen one audio interruption per transit, as opposed to once every 45 seconds on the Samsung.<br>Bad: The built in speaker is noticeably poor.  I usually use Bluetooth headsets, so this doesn't bother me that much.  It does fine for ring-tones, but not for music and even the voices sound distant.  I like the stylus, but a lack of pressure sensitivity makes using it feel like a palm pilot from the mid '90s.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This phone was purchased as unlocked and does NOT work on ANY network as advertised and came setup for MetroPCS BUT LG Customer Service said it should work on BoostMobile Network\n</span>', '<span>\n  I like using a Stylus\n</span>', '<span>\n  I love this phone! It is large in the hand, so that takes some getting use to. Overall i like the size, because it has a wide screen for viewing videos. The only thing that caught me off guard is the seller describes it as an ""unlocked phone"". I was expecting to receive a phone with no carrier apps preloaded. The one i received was locked to Metro PCS, with their apps preloaded. I was previously with AT&amp;T, so i just had to switch to Tmobile in order to have service on this phone. It worked out, but i wouldn\'t describe this phone as ""Unlocked"".\n</span>', '<span>\n  Surfing or browsing with it is fast which i like. Overall a great phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Wow, pleasantly surprised. I really am. I am a previous Stylo user. I think it was Stylo 2 or G Stylo years ago. This phone had great YouTube Reviews and Amazon reviews so I wanted to try it out. Glad I did. The charger is a rapid charger, I can have it fully charged in less than 45 mins most of the time. I love the screen size, I can’t stand smartphones with small screens, this one is basically just as big as the iPhone 8+,I have even put it inside of some of my old cases while I waited for my case to arrive. Of course the buttons don’t align, but it got me through. It offers facial recognition and fingerprints but I don’t use them. I use T-Mobile, so after putting in the SIM I had no problems at all. The only thing I don’t like is the camera quality, but when you’re coming from a broken iPhone 8+ with portrait mode it’s easy to complain lol. It’s still tolerable, just not nearly as fancy. Love the LG SmartWorld App because I can customize my wallpapers and icons to cute themes, some free. Overall I do recommend the phone and would definitely buy again.\n</span>']"

And then calling after to finally get through to a supervisor who just gave us the reimbursement. This took almost a month and I still had to purchase a new phone in the midst of all of this.

I contacted the seller's helpline and their recommendation was to return the phone.  Please note, the first thing you'll see when you open the phone box is a big sticker explaining what you need to do to return the phone...big red flag!!

The seller offered me a $25 refund via email, but as this isn\'t what I consider to be ""like new,"" I\'m returning this phone.<br><br>From seller ""OM-WIRELESS"": I received a refund for the phone I got from the seller mentioned above and then ordered one from OM-WIRELESS. This one is great! The packaging seemed to be original and included a charger and cable. The phone is absolutely like new, without a single scratch or blemish.

Don’t waste your time with ordering from here.\n</span>', '<span>\n  My ""certified refurbished"" phone had a defective microphone out of the box. Seems to me that would be important to test. It was a known issue with the early model.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I wanted to wait until the Pixel 3, but I found myself in a situation where I needed a new phone sooner than I thought. My 4 year old workhorse, last of its breed (removable battery), Galaxy S5 did not play well with a custom android ROM update. It decided to kill my cell service. The thought of going back to the bloated, ancient, unpatched, vanila android was not appealing at all.<br><br>A new Pixel 2 was my first choice, but I couldn't get that shipped next day. I ordered this certified refurbished one instead and I wasn't sure what to expect. When I received it, I inspected it closely. I was trying very hard to find any kind of cosmetic flaw. I could not find a single tiny scuff or mark. Not one! That's a great start. It looks brand spanking new. Next, I turned it on. Fast forward a few days, mostly because my service provider support sucks, but I finally got this phone setup and working the way I want.<br><br>This phone is blazing fast! The camera has some kind of magical software that makes every photo look amazing. I love the front facing stereo speakers. They sound nice and clear. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone is positioned perfectly and it works just as perfectly. Compared to my 4 year old Galaxy S5, there is nothing revolutionary here, but every single aspect is done so much better that the overall package is a pretty big leap forward. I can't really say anything negative about it. The only thing that would make this phone perfect for me is if it had a removable battery. I did find one issue, but from what I understand it's a bug with Wifi in the latest version of Android and not specific to this phone. When the phone first tries to connect to my Wifi router at work, it actually causes the router to reboot. After the router reboots, the wifi connection works fine with the phone after that. I don't think it's only Asus, but apparently this is common with Asus routers RT-AC66U and RT-N66U. Asus tries pointing their finger at the phone being the issue, and it probably is due to the bug in android, BUT my phone doesn't kill my Netgear router at home. So clearly, Asus has some blame. No buggy wifi device, no matter how bugged it is should be able to take down an entire network that easily. So if you have one of the routers above, proceed with caution.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who's looking for a great android device. I'm glad I discovered how great an Amazon certified refurbished phone is because I may never buy new again. The one I received looks brand new and it cost much less then new!\n</span>""]"

This is the third Stylo I have owned.  Why you say?  Because I broke the screens on the others through carelessness.  Otherwise I'd probably still be using them, and still have a Stylo 3 in the family.  Great thing about these is if you break the screen their cost is just a little more than the cost of replacing the screen.  But a good screen protector and case will cure that.  I like this one so much I will probably retire my Stylo 3 in the near future.  My only negative is that I don't like that they repositioned the stylus keeper to the bottom of the phone.

I bought it from Google, I still use it. I bought this refurbished version for my child. Good phone, low cost. Bad move.  The battery is garbage, The phone goes from 100% to 50% in two hours, then immediately dies. Indicative of a bad/old battery. Very obvious the phone was not refurbished but simplly repackaged and and sold.  Don't waste your money.  Also refurbished unit is not sold by Huawei. So feel free it insult Amazon for for enabling fraud.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  As an iPhone convert, I was a little skeptical about making the move to Nexus and Android as a whole. I thought the transfer of my data would be hard (it wasn't), and I had a bunch of misconceptions about Android that were ultimately way wrong. I've made the switch and I don't think I'm ever going back.<br><br>What Google has made is not only the iPhone's cheaper competitor, but also the Android OS as it was made to be; in it's purest form. I've always associated the Android OS with bloatware from carriers, resulting in a not so minimal and often ugly-looking phone. I've also never experienced Android on a premium device, meaning that it left a bad taste in my mouth when I used the OS on some cheap devices. But with Nexus, you get the real Android experience. Everything is buttery smooth, fast, fluid, intuitive, and most importantly, customizable. From the ground up, you can make your phone the way you want it to be. It's up to you how you want your phone to work.<br><br>Anyways, enough about the OS. Let's talk about the phone itself and what makes it great.<br><br>1. Price &amp; Value<br><br>I buy my electronics for the long haul. The 6P is built superbly and has Gorilla Glass protecting its front and back. Despite what other say, I also find it easy to hold and don't worry about losing my grip on it. The 6P is sturdy, sleek, and unique all at the same time.<br><br>I also want a good deal too. The 6P delivers on both of those fronts. It's main competitor, the iPhone 6s Plus, is $649 unlocked, and that's for a 16GB model. My 32GB 6P cost around ~$400 after some discounts at Best Buy. There's no doubt in my mind that the 6P is one of the best deals on the market right now.<br><br>2. Fingerprint Scanner<br><br>The placement of the fingerprint scanner (top of the back) is perfect. It's just real natural to place your finger there to unlock your phone, nothing awkward about it. You can also log multiple fingerprints too, meaning that you could pick up the phone with either hand and unlock it. If you prefer not having to enter a password, your prints can be used to buy apps from the Play Store and open certain apps. The scanner is also one of the fastest, if not the fastest out there. The scanner is also incredibly accurate as well. In the few days I've used it, I can count on my hand the number of times it's incorrectly read my print, and that's probably user error.<br><br>Simply put, Google is killing it here.<br><br>3. Camera<br><br>Talk about a nice camera. I'll let the pictures I took do the talking. While Google's camera app leaves a little to be desired at times, it gets the job done. The camera performs great in all kinds of lighting, and is adept at adjusting to its surroundings. 12 MP is as good as it gets right now in smartphones, and while it's not DSLR-quality, your Instagram feed will still look good. Speaking of DSLR, I took some photos with my Nikon D40 for comparison. The first two are Nexus.<br><br>*the photos below were untouched.*<br><br>4. Design/Size<br><br>First of all, this phone isn't big at all. No, you don't need to be Lana from Archer to use this phone. I upgraded from a meager iPhone 4s, and was quite concerned about this phone's seemingly gargantuan size. But once you get it in hand, you'll see that you were worried about nothing. It's hard to explain, but you'll never want to have a small phone again after your first day with the 6P. It just feels right. Once you learn how to cradle the phone the right way, you'll forget about the phone's size.<br><br>If you're still worried about the size, check out this site to compare the 6P to your current phone.<br><br>http://www.phonearena.com/phones/size<br><br>I will concede that on some apps, it's mildly inconvenient to stretch your finger all the way across the screen, but this is a small tradeoff for the big beautiful screen that you get.<br><br>I gushed about the design a bit earlier, but it really is the cat's balls. The front-facing speaker is loud and clear, and won't muffle unless you put your phone face down. On the top, the earpiece produces great call quality and makes it easy to hear your caller. The phone is easy to hold, and the power/volume buttons don't get in the way. The aluminum and metal build make the phone feel and look premium, and it seems as if Google didn't cut any corners in designing this unit.<br><br>5. Battery Life<br><br>A lot of critics have been gushing about this, and rightfully so. Without adjusting any of my settings, or using any battery management apps, the 6P can easily make it through a day and then some of heavy use. This varies of course, but I'm content as long as my phone makes it though the day without needing a charge. If you mess with your settings and/or use apps, the 6P can easily last you a couple of days if you manage the battery effectively. You can also easily analyze which apps are effecting battery performance.<br><br>Using Google's official cable/adaptor, it takes about a little more than an hour for my phone to go from zero to one-hundred. That's from zero to one-hundred real quick. While the whole USB-C setup isn't exactly ubiquitous yet, it's fast and great for data transfer. The USB-C is reversible and can also be used to reverse charge, meaning that your 6P could charge someone else's USB-C device.<br><br>6. Software/Hardware<br><br>As I said before, Android is what you make of it. Marshmallow is a great OS, and that's amplified by the fact that Google gives you no bloatware or add-ons. I believe that out of the box, only around 3 GB of the 32 total GB is occupied. It's the purest form of Android, how it was meant to be. Everything flows great. Google Now and it's cards are also really convenient once it gets to learn about you. The animations are smooth, glitchless, and the phone is fast thanks to 3GB of RAM. Nexus users also get Android updates first before the general populace, meaning your phone is up-to-date. You can expect these Nexus-only benefits to grow in the future as Google makes it like their iPhone.<br><br>The Nexus is also equipped with real good hardware. The Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, and Adreno 430 GPU all work in harmony to keep your experience with games, apps, and multitasking lag-free. The Samsung AMOLED 1440 display is also one of the best screens on the market right now. Heck, the pictures I took looked way better on my Nexus before I uploaded them on my laptop. Colors are bright and vibrant, and video is top-class. The brightness also has a wide range. At its lowest, the screen is even a little too dark for nighttime use. At it's brightest, it can contend with the bright sun.<br><br>7. Cellular Data<br><br>I've been using Google's Project Fi thus far, and I'm really impressed. I got my SIM card in the mail and a nice phone stand LEGO set from them in the mail free of charge. Porting my number over took about five minutes, and my service has been great. Fi uses T-Mobile and Sprint for data, and places calls over Wi-Fi when possible by using encryption/VPN. Using my phone out and about almost seemed faster than my in-home Internet, and calls over both Wi-Fi and cell were clear and great quality. You can also manage your data in the Settings by alerting you when your data used reaches a certain amount, and you can even set a limit that will turn off your phone's data when exceeded.<br><br>8. Misses<br><br>While the Nexus 6P is great by almost every standard in the book, here are a few things I wish this phone would have.<br><br>- wireless charging<br>- dual SIM port<br>- expandable micro SD<br>- removable battery<br>- different screenshot option (Pressing power/volume down at the same time is awkward. Thankfully you can long press the home button and press the share button on the left to bypass this.)<br><br>Overall, the Nexus 6P is probably the best value on the phone market. You've got top-of-the-line performance at a significant discount from its main competitor in the Apple 6s Plus, and you get Android in its greatest form. With a great camera, display, hardware, software, and preferred treatment from Google, the Nexus 6P should be in your pocket.<br><br>PICS<br><br>#1 &amp; #2: shot with Nexus 6P; no editing<br>#3 &amp; 4: shot with Nikon D40 DSLR; no editing<br>#5: Backside of 6P<br>#6: My gross hand<br>#7: Backside with camera/mic/scanner<br>#8: Side (SIM port on top left)<br>#9: My home screen.

Great for analyzing when and what effects your battery.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  My phone is at the same 1.5 year mark as everyone else and it\'s shutting down at 25+% battery. Also It\'ll show in the battery settings that it\'s used about 4% of the battery, but the battery itself is at 81%. That being said, I unplugged it from the charger at 5 am, took it to work and put it in my locker where it\'s sat with GPS, bluetooth and everything else off. I then check at 9 am and voila it\'s at 81% after having done nothing for 4 hours. This has become much more apparent over the course of the last few months, along with a host of other issues that are cropping up (similar to the other 1 star comments)<br><br>As for the phone itself:<br><br>The camera takes pretty good pictures and has a photo-sphere function that I love to use for my 3D modeling (not a selling point for everyone). I\'ve never had major issues with the camera other than that.<br><br>Software was working good for the most part up until these battery issues showed up and now certain things like Google Drive will re-start uploads from 1-2 months ago that never finished due to connectivity or something and just show ""UPLOADING"" till I restart the phone.<br><br>Cell service has been decent but on the spotty side if I do say so myself. I switched from a Sprint phone to this thinking that I\'d get the best of both worlds and it seems like I get less coverage than either sprint or t-mobile (which Fi is supposedly using both). My guess is that both companies are giving Google Fi their worst bandwidth/frequencies at a discount rate. Either way, I drop one of every 5 calls and wi-fi calling will cut in and out randomly on my phone while my roommates are also using the wi-fi calling on apple or Samsung products and not having any issues. All of this being said, I don\'t call most of the time and I really like paying only for what I use, and usually go under my 2Gb limit for the month. So there\'s that.<br><br>In Summary: I wish now that I\'d spend the extra $50 to $100 dollars on a manufacturer that would\'ve made this phone with more quality parts. I like the phone in general and feel cheated having to spend another $5-600 getting a new phone seeing as this one is becoming unusable after only 1.5 years. Bummer.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Battery problems with phone shutting down randomly even with 95% battery charged. Ordered phone in March of 2016 and used it until September of 2017 when the problem started happening all of a sudden.

I must admit that I first I loved it but in less than a year, it became useless.  Just go on the Google, and you'll see there is a known issue with this device's software and battery .  It leads to quick battery drain followed by the device shutting down (often with 20-25% battery left).  Other customers get locked into a bootloop.  Both Google and Huawei acknowledge the issue but that doesn't help you if this phone is your only means of communications.  If you purchase directly from Google, they will do an immediate exchange but dealing with Huawei can be a nightmare or be a process that takes up to a month.  Huawei rep freely admitted that the device they send back to you might encounter the problem again.  Google support just tells you they are aware of the problem but that is no fix.  Unlike Apple, you have no physical store to go to. You have no loaner phone to use while you send the phone away for months.  Im so disappointed and angry with this fiasco as the owner of the device has no landline, needs phone access to communicate with medical professionals or even take an Uber.  Long story short, this phone is too good to be true.  If you havent encountered the problems yet, be glad.  They will come for most people.  Google says the problem involves software updates but after all this time, there are no fixes.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Huawei Phones were built with faulty main computer boards that crash to an unsolvable boot loop in a short period of time. Calling the product manufacturer line at 888-548-2934 the manufacturer's official stance is if your $500 product is out of warranty for a year and this known fatal design flaw kicks in at 13 months (which it will) they do not stand behind their product and the only resolution offered is for you to buy a new phone from them. I would give them a zero if I could. I do not mind paying for quality, in this case they are charging a premium for a known faulty device and do not stand behind what they make. Shame on Huawei and shame on Google for this scam.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  My goodness!  After reading some of the winey reviews I was concerned about the battery and immediately ran several battery calibration and testing apps.  This battery is in good condition.  This phone, although it was previously used, appears to have been reconditioned with some newer exterior parts and had a full charge.  The seller is commended!<br>Let me share the truth (as I see it) about the Nexus 6P.  Huawei has made one of the best smart phones ever with the Nexus 6P.  This model came out a couple of years ago but still out preforms most other phones out there.  The 6P models have gorilla glass - they are really hard to crack.  The processors are really fast and the phone still operates smoothly even when it has been loaded up with a lot of junk apps. The display screen is large and easy to read.  Here is something interesting;  My other phone still works great but it was almost full having 64BG memory, this one has 128GB memory.  When I transferred all my information from my other Nexus 6P, the space taken went from 59GB to 18GB.<br>I restored my other phone (or had the memory wiped clean) and gave it to a friend who is thrilled to have such a good phone.<br>This phone is so good that Google has stopped supporting it as of Dec. 2018, so no new updates unless you root the phone and that is a little complicated.  Google just wants you to spend money on another phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I will never buy another Huawei again. It\'s been in for service 3 or 4 times in the first 6 months - once because they forgot to reattach the camera - dah. Sometimes the screen will not recognize your finger. I thought it was me until I passed the phone if to my doctor\'s receptionist and she asked if I always had that problem. Since the last time it was in for service it seldom recognizes my voice - and I usually have to scream into the phone for it to recognize my voice. So frustrating. I\'ve trained and retrained the voice module to no avail. It has a feature that keeps the phone unlocked when at certain coordinates that you set as safe places. Yeah, that doesn\'t work anymore either. This is the first time I spent $600 on a phone and will NEVER make that mistake again. The $30 LG I bought to use while this was in for service (again and again) worked nearly as well. I especially liked on the LG that I could say ""whiskey"" and it would take Picture. This phone doesn\'t have that option and since it\'s so big you really have to use both hands to touch the button. Disappointing.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Well I\'ve seen it in the headlines and always thought I was lucky to not have the ""phone turns itself off while still having 50 to 60 percent battery left"" but here I am adding myself to that boat of people. This can be dangerous if you are on a trip or journey without being able to make a phone call or use GPS. Even though I have half my battery life left or more, the phone becomes useless. I am lucky to be okay making my phone a brick and adding the zerolemon battery case to it so that when my phone decides it wants outlet power in order to function again, I just flip a button and my case charges the phone from the 10,000 Mah battery case I attached to the phone. Others are not so lucky or willing to have such a large phone in their pocket. Nobody is doing anything to fix the bug either. I am disappointed and unable to afford another device for about another year or so. I hope that my battery case can last me that long otherwise I\'m really screwed. It\'ll get a huge workout basically being on all day long for a year straight cause the phone can\'t power itself anymore. Useless....\n</span>', '<span>\n  I just want to say that I rarely write reviews but I felt like I should as a warning to anyone that buys Google Nexus phones or any other Google phones. I really liked this smartphone and I have had many smartphones ever since 2007. I bought this phone near the end of March 2016. My Nexus 6p has had a screen protective and case since I got it. I have been very careful with it and always updated the phone with all of the OTA security updates and official Android updates. After downloading the July 2017 OTA update, I had something weird happen. The loudspeaker on Nexus 6P would not work if I tried using it on speakerphone. It will still play ringtones, music, audio from videos on Youtube, etc. The only thing that it will not do is speakerphone which is a feature that I use a lot. I contacted Google support and was trying to troubleshoot the phone for over 2 hours which only consisted of doing a Factory Data Reset. I had to backup my videos, photos, etc on my phone. What Google support didn\'t tell me is that I would lose all my text messages that were on the phone. This should have been something they told me before I did a factory data wipe. I thought that the Google backup would include my text messages but whatever. After over 2 hours, the data reset did nothing to fix my problem. They told me that since I didn\'t buy the phone directly from Google that they could no longer help me. It seems that Google only stands behind their products if and only if you buy them directly from Google. They promised me that Huawei would be able to help me as Google has ""excellent manufacturers"" that stand behind their product. This was an absolute lie. Huawei had the worst customer support that I have ever called. The representative from Huawei was very rude and said that they could do nothing as I was out of my factory warranty range (remember that I bought this phone around the 28th of March 2016. My warranty has barely expired and they offered no help. They couldn\'t even tell me if the OTA update caused the issue with my phone. They could not tell me where to buy parts for my Nexus 6p even though Huawei is the manufacturer of the phone. I was floored by this fact. Customer support wouldn\'t even suggest where I could take the phone for help. My overall conclusion is this: Please do not buy Google branded smartphones and do not buy Huawei products. They will not stand behind their products and will not help you solve your issues with their products. I have been a fan of Android based smartphones for a long time but I think an Apple smartphone will be in my future. Shame on Google and Shame on Huawei. You will not get my business anymore. Your reluctance to help your loyal customers is very disappointing. It seems you have gotten to the point where your customers are not your priority. The all mighty dollar is all you care about. If you have read my review, please share it with others to prevent them from facing the same fate. Thank you for reading this review.\n</span>']"

Ordered a black phone yet received a white one, the back is cracked, one speaker doesn't work, screen was scratched up, and the battery life seems to be running out unusually fast. I can look past most of the issues as they are fairly situational, but the bottom of the screen is buggy, and there is a portion of the screen where colors are slightly brighter. From what I can tell, it's a gamble whether or not it's worth it. One common observation is that the quality is depreciated similarly to the price, you might be paying less, but it will last considerably less long than a full price model.<br><br>Update: next day<br>The charging port disconnects charging, and unplug itself if not being held in. It would not be out of order to be using a rubber band to keep it plugged in.  The cherry on top of all this: the phone is not allowing calls, claiming a faulty SIM card. After testing with my Huawei P Smart, I can confirm that the phone is faulty.<br><br>As much as I want to not be wasteful and keep it, I simply cannot use this.

Battery life is good, not great.

Couldn't be happier.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  In short, this phone seems more aptly described as ""used"" in condition than ""refurbished.""<br><br>I was under the impression that the difference between ""used"" and ""refurbished"" was that refurbished phones are inspected and any sub-par parts are replaced with parts that meet the requirements. These phones (I purchased 2 - one for myself and one for my mother) appear to simply have been taken in, factory reset, and resold. The processors seem to be in decent shape, but the batteries have a shorter life than our previous phones that we both used for 3 years without ever replacing the battery. My Pixel 2 also has an issue where as soon as it\'s below 20%, it has a random chance of suddenly shutting off at any given moment. The refurbished condition also states that there may be minor cosmetic flaws, but both of our phones have scratches on the screen - they are small enough that they aren\'t a constant distraction, but large enough to occasionally get in the way of some things being displayed on the screen.<br><br>Overall, the phones were a bit disappointing in some departments, but the performance is fine for the price paid.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Performance is good. This thing will run GameCube games at full speed with the right settings. Don't bother though, because your Bluetooth controller will cut out every 3 seconds. Battery life is a joke after just one year of ownership and the USB-C port won't hold the charge cable anymore, so I have to hold the cable in place myself. This means trying to use headphones or anything else that requires a dongle is a pain in the ass. Don't get this phone.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone was in great shape. It worked as advertised. The problem was the battery. You could visibly watch the battery drain like sand through an hourglass. After running tests on battery health, the battery had less than half of the capacity it should.  The amount of mAh added per percentage of battery added over the course of more than 10 charging cycles was recorded to get an exact accurate result.  Ordered a replacement. Again phone was immaculate but same battery issue. The second one was a 2% increase in battery capacity. If you never need to use your phone for more than 60 minutes before charging , you will be set. If you do, not so much. In my opinion, it renders everything else useless if the battery is shot.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  The unit I received is almost brand new. There was a single unnoticeable dent at the button edge other than that I was quite surprised how new the phone was.<br>But I am someone who like to tinker around and change the roms quiet often which I couldn't do because of the locked bootloader. And you won't be able to unlock since this was a verizon based model before.<br>Other than this, I  like the phone.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I've owned a Google Pixel 2 for the past couple years.  Even though I'm not a fan of Google (the company), I've really loved this phone.  I recently dropped it and broke the screen.  The charging port was also worn out (which made charging difficult), so I decided to purchase the exact same phone through Amazon.  From the minute I started using the phone, it would power off at weird times such as doing a Google search or using while trying to use Google maps.  I was also disappointed in how fast the battery drained (unlike my original Google Pixel 2).  After a few weeks of this, I was over it and decided to return it.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I had the pixel 1 32 GB and ran out of memory fast got this one and has double the memory but all the new features helps me quickly get to my messages and notifications and get back to work.

I got mine and the camera didn't even work. You'd hit the camera app icon, and the screen would stay black, then the app would shutdown. It's not like buying a car where you have all the details knowing if the car's been in any accidents, and can test drive it. I would strongly suggest if you need a pixel phone bad enough to get a new pixel 3a since they aren't as expensive. Don't learn the hard way like I did.\n</span>""]"

I love this phone. After having the phone for a bit, I just recorded a video for the first time. The audio levels on the video are extremely low. I have the volume all the way up and the sound in the video is basically inaudible. This seems to be a common issue with this phone model.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>So far so good! So, why the four star rating? In the description of the phone, it says ""Product works and looks like new"". The phone I got is in good condition and you can tell the previous owner took care of the phone. However, there are some light scratches and blemishes on the phone, so I can\'t say the phone ""looks like new"". I might be nitpicking, but I know this information can be helpful to someone else out there.<br><br>As for how the phone is performing: I just got the phone about an hour ago but everything seems to be working. I\'ve read reviews here on Amazon stating horror stories about the camera crashing or not opening. That hasn\'t happened to me yet. If something changes, I will update this review.<br><br>Update: about a month later, and I still feel the same as what I wrote above.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I bought this through Amazon\'s renewed program. Looking at other reviews, it seems it might be a bit hit or miss whether you get a phone in ""like new"" condition. The phone I got was in excellent condition. There were no scratches on the screen or body. The metal rim around the front is a bit scoffed but besides that it looks like brand new.<br><br>As for the phone itself, the Pixel 2 offers tremendous value at about $100. The processor is very powerful and the ram is more than adequate. The Pixel 2 offers better performance than many phones in the $300-$400 dollar range. For example, the processor on the Pixel 2 is substantially more powerful than the processor on the Pixel 3a.<br><br>Pros<br>- Excellent performance<br>- Nice looking, high resolution screen<br>- Pure, clean up-to-date Android<br>- Excellent build quality<br>- Thin and light<br><br>Cons<br>- Hilariously large bezels (which results in an already very dated design)<br>- No expandable memory<br>- No headphone jack<br>- So-so battery life (no idea how much capacity is in my battery)<br>- Not true dual sim<br><br>While the Pixel 2 is not a perfect phone, it\'s an excellent deal for the price. My experience with Amazon renewed has so far been a good one. Very happy with what I got for a hundred bucks.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Big mistake buying this and not paying attention to the negative reviews.<br><br>This is not a phone for someone who uses it LIKE A PHONE i.e. to talk to other human beings.  When you take the phone away from your ear - which one needs to do from time to time - the phone will mute you, then you have to reopen the call so you can be heard. How many times have I heard ""hello??? hello?? are you there?"" and I have been talking to no one because of this STUPID feature.<br><br>It is also very easy for your cheek to engage the mute button STUPIDLY located at cheek level.<br><br>If you\'re a young person who doesn\'t understand that phones can be used to speak with other human beings, this might just be the phone for you. I don\'t play games. I do text. That feature is fine. I never figured out how to upload music to it (easy to do on my old cheapo phone). but i have spotify so not a big problem. Nor have I figured out how to record my voice (also easy to do on my old phone).<br><br>The camera and video are better than average - which was a selling point - but really don\'t offset the annoyance of the problems I mentioned. I have good cameras which I can use if I want. I want a phone TO BE A PHONE (yes, I\'m over 50).<br><br>Also battery life is bad. Who gives a darn about the finger-print feature (just what I need, my finger-prints on file with google and who knows who else - so much for my life of crime!).<br><br>Gong back to the $100 cheapo. Will keep this for the camera if I can resist the temptation to smash it to bits.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This seems like a really nice phone but I can't get it to read my SIM card. I was able to set up everything on the phone using wifi, my contacts, my apps, my whole google account. But when I install the sim card into the tray nothing is detected. I tried several times. If I take the sim card out and put it back into my old phone everything works perfectly. That's the risk you run when buying a refurbished phone I guess. I'm sure most of the refurbished phones people buy here are great but I was unlucky and got one that does not work properly. That's the gamble, just be aware.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  This phone hemorrhages electricity. I charge it up to capacity at night, and it\'s down to 70% by morning.

If I had been looking for a glossy black sign that flashed the words, ""Pixel launcher keeps stopping"" continuously.<br><br>The return process, however, has been really sharp.  Company addressed my concerns and authorized a return instantly. Their service was so good, in fact, that I am going to give them another try. I\'ve ordered the exact same product from this seller. If it works, I will upgrade the stars in my review. If it doesn\'t I\'m taking two away.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  After seeing a few of these reviews where buyers said they received a damaged phone, I was concerned. But the phone that I received was in excellent condition -- I couldn't find any marks or defects at all. It seems indistinguishable from a brand new Pixel 2, except perhaps for the lack of shrink wrap on the body. Not that it was needed, because the device was still well packaged. The package included what I would have expected: the rapid charger, the USB-C to 3.5 mm headphone dongle (but no actual headphones or earbuds), and a USB-C to USB micro B adapter that allowed me to connect it to my old phone for transferring my apps and data. During setup, I was also able to bring over the Cricket SIM card from my previous phone, and setup worked smoothly. Happy with this purchase.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I wondered about getting a ""renewed"" phone, but glad I did. The Pixel 2 may not be produced anymore ( stopped in April 2019), but it is still the best smaller smartphone out there. Phones are getting too big. It looks new, was completely reset to factory condition. No problem sticking in a SIM and attaching it to my carrier. It ran the update to pie (Android 9) and did the latest security patches. They are working on an Android 10 beta for the Pixel 2 now so when released it will most likely be rolled out to this phone. Great flexibility with an unlocked phone. Has both SIM slot and eSIM for Google Fi. No headphone adapter, but it did come with a descent charger. Fantastic camera. I checked the battery condition with the AccuBattery app, mine has 92%  of battery design capacity left - not bad. Charges quick. very happy with the purchase!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  The phone bricked after one month. Black screen and then wouldn't come on again. We chose to go to Google to get a replacement and got yet another defective phone. That one the camera would not stay open. This company here will not give us a refund since we don't have the original phone. Word to the wise... Always return your electronics to Amazon, not the manufacturer. Google said they'll give us some kind of refund if after three trades with them the phone we have is defective. I doubt they will give us the $159 we paid this Amazon Seller. It was Christmas time so we didn't mind overpaying, but we didn't realize our son would be without a phone for over two months.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  These phones aren't like new.  The screens have been replaced.  Everything else shows wear.  I had paint wear on the chassis, the speaker ports have some serious dirt in them, my wife's (bought at the same time) speaker mesh was severely dented in and scratched.  And it comes with the most generic, low power AC adapter ever made.  You won't be fast-charging, that's for sure.<br><br>These are NOT in like new conditions.  While the listing warns of generic accessories, it doesn't state clearly enough that they aren't giving you accessories compatible with the features of the phone.  There's literal dirt caked in mine.<br><br>Find a better seller if you're looking for a renewed phone.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I was super excited when I first got this phone, but within 2 weeks it\'s true colors stared showing. My device would overheat whenever I had a video call. Skype, Whatsapp, Duo, Google Hangouts, IG, it didn\'t matter what you used for video chats, within 5 mins of a call the phone would overheat and shut off. I was not outdoors in direct sunlight and I had no other applications running, but it overheated on EVERY call I had and all within 5 mins. Furthermore, battery life was terrible. I would have to keep this phone on battery save mode the entire day just so it wouldn\'t die by lunch. The phone would report ""12% battery life, you have 1 hour left of regular usage"" and it would die 5 minutes later. I can\'t tell if this is an issue because the phone was ""refurbished"", but I see a lot of people online reporting the same issues with this phone.

This model however was poorly thought out. The battery Moto mod is a necessity if you use your phone a lot during the day. After an hour or so in the gym and then streaming music in my car and using Google maps while driving, the phone without the battery pack is at 30% by 3pm. The problem is that a protective case will not fit with the mod on. The mod is a smooth surface so it's slipping out of your hand constantly. I ended up dropping the phone and breaking it within a month. Thankfully Amazon refunded me the full amount ( I was truthful with my customer service rep and he did more than he had to) because of the full screen without an edge a case creates you also end up opening apps accidentally. You may want to go to a retail store and check out this phone in person before you purchase it to make sure your can live with the white mentioned concerns.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I\'ve had this for a month or two and like it quite a bit. The included battery pack is a huge convenience, with it attached the battery can easily last two full days of medium-heavy use. Easily the best battery life of any smartphone that I\'ve owned. Screen is large and looks good. Camera is fine, nothing exceptional, but not bad either. Minimal bloatware preinstalled. No issues switching over my Verizon SIM card.<br><br>Two minor complaints - the phone does sometime freeze up when using apps, and I will need to wait a minute or two for them to catch back up before I can do anything. Some performance issues are to be expected from a mid-range phone, and it doesn\'t happen often enough to be a huge issue, but it is kind of annoying. Secondly, it doesn\'t seem like Motorola is really making cases that are designed for use with the battery pack. This made sense for the Z2 Play when the battery pack was an optional accessory, sold separately. But now that they\'re bundling the battery pack with the Z3 Play, I think that they should realize that a lot of their customers will be using the battery pack at all times, and design cases accordingly. I didn\'t want to constantly be taking the battery and cases on and off, so I had to settle for a $15 ""bumper case"", which is really just a plastic ring that goes around the edge of the phone. It seems to give some protection, but it\'d be nice if I could use a true case with the battery pack.<br><br>Complaints aside, I would buy this phone again and would recommend it to others. If you\'re not a complete power user that has to have the absolute cutting edge phone, this phone is probably plenty powerful for you, and you\'ll save a lot of money compared to the latest Galaxy/iPhone. The battery life is also incredible.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  As a mobile Android and iPhone app developer (ADSNELLC Development) I find this Moto Z3 Play quite solid and reliable for use and app building and compiling software, even over Samsung products. My last 2 Android developer phones were all Samsung products (S4 &amp; S6) and each phone developed pixel line problems in the screens after 2 years of use because of cheap components and potential for software corruption on Samsung's and battery drain is worse on Samsung than Motorola. I plan on developing mods and additional apps for Android and Motorola products. Forgot to mention this link is a case that WILL fit the phone and power Mod combined.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ELL12KK/ref=cm_sw_r_other_taa_l0XwCbH5YABBE\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  This is an excellent mid-range phone. Pulled my Straight Talk sim card out of my Straight Talk phone and put it in this one. Service transferred right over to the new phone.<br>PROS: Battery life is amazing. GPS is accurate. Call quality is clear. Resolution is great. WiFi works well. Very responsive. Excellent graphics. So many cool mods that can be used with this phone. (Extra power, speakers, projector, etc.)<br>CONS: The only issues I have with this phone are the missing UI settings. I am unable to get the screen to stop coming on automatically, and I can't turn on immersive mode. (Maybe there's an app to bypass these restrictions)\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I bought this phone WITHOUT the Amazon integrations.  I've read that they can't be disabled or removed from that models version of Android, but I can't confirm that.  That said, I did find it to be a big enough issue that I paid a little more the version without it.<br><br>I love this phone. I switched from an Essential Ph1 and have owned pretty much every Samsung flagship released in the past 5 years.  I'm on a personal boycott of Samsung after they failed to honor my warranty on my Note, but that's another review on a different website.  I honestly don't like theiecosystem and experience that Samsung has built.  It kinda feels like a bizarre version of iOS at times.<br><br> Moving on...<br><br>With the ZPlay 3, I really see little difference other than the frequency of updates provided by Motorola, Motorola is significantly slower, and the lack of any fluff and customization as provided by Samsung.  Essential basically releases updates immediately after Google, so the bar is extremely high in that regard.<br><br>Motorola has been slower to release updates than I would like, but the updates have been flawless.  This phone has very little bloatware.  It's extremely close to stock Android and really quick.  I've had zero issue and very little slow down if any.<br><br> I rarely play games on my phone, but have no gameplay issues when I do.  Load times aren't terrible, but they certainly aren't the fastest.  Think Mustang, not Corvette.<br><br> Motorola should've had the latest OS update to this phone way faster, but their customization of Android mimicked it pretty well.<br><br>The motomads are pretty cool.  I basically always have the extra battery on unless I'm using the projector to screen Netflix on the hotel ceiling if traveling.  Battery life is close to two full days in this configuration.  It will even get you through a full work day without the extra battery.  Not having the fastest processor on the market actually helps a bit in that regard.  I do love using the projector mod  while paired with a a good Bluetooth speaker. The factory speaker sounds pretty good, but isn't loud enough if more than one person is trying to listen.<br><br>Bottom Line:<br>If you don't want to spend flagship money this phone will serve you well.  If you have no need for the mods, check out the Motorola G7.  It's a great budget phone and can be had cheaper than the ZPlay 3.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  i love the size of the screen and the system runs very smoothly. camera and fingerprint scanner are great. however, I'm more than displeased with the performance of the battery.  a ten-minute video call and half an hour of texting drops the power down to 70 %. this was with the data and location services off and power save mode on. without the battery mod, this phone would be a 300 dollar paperweight in about 6 hours. if not less. I'm a little wary of trying to use GPS on it to get anywhere without the charge cord for fear of being stranded after the battery dies.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Diehard Motorola fan. Replacing Moto X Pure with issues. Camera setup is not as nice, but overall value is good. Handset is substantial and we'll constructed. Haven't used Moto Mods battery yet, but it is charged and at the ready should the need arise. Overall happy with this purchase\n</span>"", '<span>\n  The phone feels great once I added a bumper ""case"" to add more grip. However, the phone is dropping my mobile connection from time to time and not reconnecting on its own. I have to reboot the phone to connect again.This problem did not exist with the phone being replaced, Moto X Play. I have an email pending to Motorola to see what they say. Also, I know that the phone is ready for Pie but I have not received an update and currently set at Oreo. If things don\'t improve, I\'ll have to return this to Amazon.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  This was my replacement phone after my old Motorla Z Force took a dunk in the Colorado river - in the six months Iv'e owned it, I've already had to replace the screen twice due to cracks - the first time it was  a bit of a surprise, when dropping it on the edge shattered the entire screen.  No biggie, I bought a bumper for the edges (which also worked really well to recess the fingerprint reader which would spontaneously unlock the phone when I was putting it in my pocket - a MAJOR design flaw)<br><br>Well, the screen shattered again in my pocked, presumably from something putting force on the center of the screen.  I don't even know how it happened.  So now I've ordered screen protectors, but even so, in the less than two weeks since I got the screen replaced, it's cracked again!  Thankfully it's just cosmetic this time around, but this is still pushing me to the point where I'm seriously tempted to downgrade to a used Moto Z Force just so I can have a durable phone again.<br><br>Motorola, can you pleeeeeeeeease bring back the Moto Z Force-era shattershield?

Ive contacted them five times and still don't have the label. They have gone radio silent.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I bought this on the recommendation of my son (works in IT support), and after checking online reviews. This phone exceeded expectations. I switched from a Blackberry 9930 to the Nexus 6P. After just a few hours the phone was personalized for me: several email accounts, messaging, the web (with all bookmarks), contact list, transferring MP3\'s and AVI\'s, etc. The camera, display and audio quality are great! I snapped a photo of a flower arrangement from 4\' away in a dimly lit room - someone said it looked like a high def painting. The detail and color/tonal balance was incredible for a flash photo. I know there isn\'t any image stabilization but that\'s not an issue. I really like the lack of bloatware. As a result, customization is easy - just read the online manuals and FAQs. Things work well because there\'s simple consistency across the phone\'s operation - no third party quirks to deal with or get rid of. Highly recommended. I wish I had bought one earlier. I also wish I\'d bought the 128 GB version instead of the 64 GB version.<br><br>Edit: after 1 year and 2 months there is a major problem with the battery (warranty expired last month 😠). Because I ""charged it too much"" the battery expanded, pushing the transparent screen face out of it\'s case. It was going to cost me $80! Unacceptable for such an expensive phone (at least it used to be expensive). I called Huawei and returned for service. After a week my phone is still not back. I called Huawei and they basically said, ""That\'s our policy, live with it."" Their phone support is terrible! I wish they could speak English.<br><br>Read the many one star reviews before buying this phone!!! NOT RECOMMENDED!!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  First of all, I bought this smartphone thinking it was going to be in impeccable conditions, “like new”, and even though the phone’s aluminum body has just one subtle speck the size of a grain of dust on the top left corner on the back and no other noticeable scratches, I am still very skeptical of its condition. In all honesty, I feel like the phone is in excellent conditions at first sight, but that is until one really inspects it. For some reason the seller omitted mentioning in the product description that the phone is slightly bent on the right side near the buttons, causing the screen to protrude from the aluminum bezel/bevel of the phone on the right side. I only noticed this detail after rigorous inspection, but now it is very obvious to me.<br>I saw many videos of how weak the Nexus 6P aluminum frame is due to its “woodworking” dovetail style of plastic joints that hold the mid aluminum frame, but I am upset that “Edge Cellular” did not bother pointing this out. In the end, I guess the seller would not want<br>to mention this sort of detail, as to avoid deterring any potential customer from buying the phone.<br><br>Perhaps on a lesser note, I chose this particular Nexus 6P option because I wanted the phone to include the original charger and USB cable, but that is not what it included, instead it came with a white generic charger and a white USB-C cable. Had I known, I would have purchased another option, one that came with the original essentials. I just do not understand the need to have to lie about the actual conditions of the product, perhaps some customers would have not noticed these details, but I am that guy that does and takes the time to research and even watch unboxing videos of the product, particularly because it was not going to arrive with its original box and/or packaging.<br><br>My grandma received the packaged for me, so it wasn’t until yesterday in the afternoon that I had a chance to open it up. I still have to purchase a local SIM card to test if it is really unlocked, although I feel like that won’t be a problem, but we will see tomorrow.<br><br>Another thing that they should have included, even if it were a generic version, would have been a SIM card ejector tool in order to open the phone’s SIM card tray. I hate having to use other things, as I once saw a friend break his iPhone’s tray with a safety pin. Whatever.<br><br>I am also kind of worried about its battery, because although it came with a 75% charge it almost emptied out to a whopping 22% in a couple of hours of just being turned on and just viewing a couple of YouTube videos, so it leaves me wondering. The least of my worries is the screen, sure, it has a bunch of scratches and marks of different sizes and shapes, but at least they are not those deep ones that are terribly noticeable when the screen is on or that you can feel when gliding your finger through the screen.<br><br>I am not sure what to do, because I already purchased the case, the screen protector, and USB-C to USB-A cable adapter for it, but the protrusion of the screen really bothers me to the point of wanting to return it.<br><br>I am going to have to update this review tomorrow.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Do you want to purchase a $500 brick? Then this is the phone for you! Step right up, enjoy a 'laser assisted' rear camera focus that makes me regret giving up my Saumsung S4. It gets better, Huawei tried to cover up a terrible quality camera with excessive mega-pixels (which are useless if it can't focus in the first place). Do you want to enjoy the beauty and functionality that is android only to have your phone turn into a brick just months after the warranty expires?! This phone is perfect! Who would have thought a $500 paper weight could look so nice?!<br><br>I was sitting on the subway, 70% battery, phone shows google logo, turns off. I tried 2 chargers, holding the power button for at least 4 minutes, holding power + volume up, power + volume down, plugging into laptop, button mashing, etc.. I have always kept the phone in a good case, I hadn't dropped it or done anything abnormal that day. This phone is an insult do those of us who expect durability, longevity, and quality. Do not waste your hard earned money on this. Of course, do not waste it on apple, either. Find a better android phone, and don't purchase it just because they boast pixels on the camera, make sure it actually has top of the line focus software (e.g. optical zoom, digital zoom up to 10x, etc.)\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I have had this phone for a year now, and it has started to have battery (the phone shuts down even if battery is ~50%) and microphone issues (everyone complains that I sound muffled at the other end of the line). These are common and the problem is known to both Google and Huawei.<br>However, if like me, you buy your phone through Amazon, Google isn't responsible to fix the phone/replace it for you. That falls on Huawei, who have one of the worst customer service helplines. After waiting for 45 minutes to speak to a representative, I was told that the phone will be repaired as it's a recognized problem, but I would have to wait for 1.5 months to get it back from the repair facility. It's not like I have backup phones lying around, but either way, Huawei cannot expect customers to wait for 1.5 months to get their phones repaired. I have a Motorola phone in my family, which was replaced within 4 days.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Phone was amazing for the first year.  Then I noticed over a couple months it no longer holds a decent battery charge.  The phone now lasts me about 5 hours (not using it for 5 hours...just 5 hours out of the day) with maybe half hour of SOT.  ACCUBATTERY shows the capacity around 1700 mah which is about half of the rated mah.<br><br>Just wanted to add my disappointment with Huawei.  There batteries are clearly defective yet they won't touch anything outside of their one year warranty.  Will never buy another product from them again.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Where do I even start with this phone? It's quick, its beautiful, its big, its a really sexy phone guys. The screen is bright and vibrant. The battery life is amazing. No more having to carry around my charges and external battery pack. I get about 5 hours screen on time. The finger print scanner is the best and fastest I've ever used. It's leauges better than the iPhone one. I'm able to pull my phone out of my pocket and just lay my finger on the scanner and BOOM its unlocked. The phone is quite slippery though so I'd advise buying a case with this. I got the Spigen heavy duty one. It's thin, barely adds any thickness and makes the phone way easier to grip. I love this phone. It's the best Android phone I've ever had (I've been using Android since the HTC Hero) and its definitely worth buying if you're in the market for a phone.

The biggest complaint is no separate headphone jack other than that whatever might be wrong is overshadowed by everything else be this phone does right.Every day I find more things I can do with this phone. And I love the mods. I want the projector mod and the high end camera lens mod.  Everything I want at a great price. I'm going to buy another one for my wife. Very fast and great memory storage\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Starting with the most common issues I had with this phone for the three months that it worked, top would have to be battery power: you definitely needed the included backup battery, as the Z3 Play can go through power quite quickly. I once went from 100% to 80% in an hour on one, maybe two apps, neither of which were high stress apps or games. Also, the battery charges slowly if you are doing anything with it.<br>Tying in a bit with the first issue is that there is no good case for mods for this phone. the cases I've seen either cover too much of the back to use mods, or (in the case of the one bumper case I found that I thought was viable) was passable in the use of mods, yet interfered with daily use (in my case, I couldn't use the fingerprint scanner to unlock, and I had to use excessive effort to press any of the buttons.<br>The very last issue I had, the one that broke it for me, was when the screen stopped showing anything. I had dropped it from about 4 feet up onto carpet (granted, the carpet wasn't exactly shag, but it wasn't hardwood or tile). The phone didn't land on one of the sides, corners, or screen, but on it's back. when I picked it up and inspected it, I could no longer see anything on the screen.<br>Thinking I could get it repaired, I contacted the seller to see about getting it repaired, but to no avail: they either needed me to call someone (Which I am unable to), or they needed info of the phone which I could only get (yes, you guessed it) from either the phone system or by calling a number. Very disappointed, will be looking elsewhere for a replacement.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  For the money it's a great choice.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>You're getting an upper mid tier device with the materials of a flagship.<br>The screen is great.<br>The fingerprint reader is super reliable.<br>The cameras are pretty good.<br>The Moto Battery Pack works like a treat.<br>OS is really snappy.<br><br>Cons:<br>Battery life could be better, however it's not bad.}<br>Without a mod on the back it's really uncomfortable to hold and you WILL drop it, any style shell will make it worlds better to hold, and the battery pack also helps.<br>You will sometimes unlock your device with your fingerprint when putting it in your pocket due to the location of the fingerprint reader.<br><br>Overall i've been a huge fan of Motorola ever since the 2nd gen Moto X, and this device really does bring a lot to the table.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  My screen on this phone quit after 4 months. Nothing gets it working. and the fingerprint reader on the side was almost impossible to use. Do not buy this phone. I have ordered a G7 because my G5 worked so well and I thought the razor would be a good investment. I was wrong. The only reason I got the razor was because it could use Android pay. I do not recommend this phone.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  So before it got this phone I had to moto Z2 Force I love the phone because never had any issues and also I had the Moto mods with it I have quite a few from the camera to the speakers to the extended battery and gamepad so it's a lot of investment with the mods which work great with the phone! So for me to actually replace the Moto Z2 was not a thought for a long while for at least 2 years recently I've been noticing more of the larger screens on some of the newer phones which I liked and was thinking about replacing my phone only for that reason!so I looked around for different phones but I really want to get another Moto z I thought of the Moto Z4 but some of the reviews on it we're so so mostly like the screen not being able to see outside and the way the Moto mods wouldn't fit as good on the phone itself so my other option was the Moto Z3 play which the reviews were good on it and the major part was the screen for me so it had the bigger screen the difference was is with the fingerprint scanner it was now on the right side of the phone thought it would be a problem at first but actually it was pretty good cuz I am right handed and I setup some of my fingers to work with it and it works pretty well I also did the face recognition which works well mostly in daylight cuz it has to see your face all my mods work for it great this is an unlocked phone I do have Sprint I try to put a unlocked phone on my Sprint a couple years back before my Moto Z2 and I had some issues so at first I had some major thinking about putting another unlocked phone on Sprint but it said it worked with most of all the phone carriers and Sprint was one of them and as soon as I got it before I did any major unwrapping of the phone itself I had make sure that my phone was compatible customer service with Sprint was able to hook it up the only issue is I have to go into store to get another sim card for it because the one for my other phone wouldn't work with it for some reason they said but it works great no issues I love it Moto z has been a great phone from the start I am definitely going to keep buying their phones as long as they keep making them fit the mods anyways I hope this helped you and deciding on this phone or not and just to give you a heads up I'm also carrying the case of the poetic carbon which looks and feels really good on the phone have very thin and it does protect very well so make sure you get a case and a tempered glass protector before using your phone one last thing was the only issue which is not a big deal is 64 gigs that carries on the phone I was hoping to get a 124gig storage but that wasn't really a big issue for me I just wanted to upgrade to 124 but I have to stick with 64 because that's what this phone has and also because I have a 256gb micro SD card so storage is plenty enough for me anyways feel like Moto z this is a good phone especially cuz our price has gone down it's a great buy and don't forget it also comes with an extra battery pack mod in the box!

It seems everything they make somehow stops working shortly after it is out of warranty. Too bad, because they make great products. They are just not worth it if you can only use them for a year.<br>UPDATE: Two months after getting the battery replaced (the phone was working great with the new battery) the phone got stuck in bootloop.

Unfortunately, I cannot send it back and get a replacement, but if you really want it, buy it from a google playstore (it seems they are sending you a new working device if you are reporting this issue, even after a year!). Of course, the battery cannot be replaced by the user!<br>I am very disappointed!\n</span>', '<span>\n  Bought this new for nearly $600 in 2016 on Amazon. It started out as the best phone I owned. Over time, performance got worse, even after factory reset. Radio was flaky for awhile after Nougat update until new radio firmware introduced with Oreo, which fixed that issue after nearly a year of random network drops. Not too long after and with phone being just over a year old... Bootloop of death. Nothing could revive it. Not even flashing a fresh ROM. Not even the fix that third-party developers made to work around the issue. The manufacturer was no help which was the reason I had to resort to such attempts to save my $600 investment. I bought a ZTE Blade V8 Pro as an emergency replacement that I actually turned out to be mostly happy with and decided to keep. With the clearance at the store that I bought it from on top of a sale price, I got it for less than $100 even though it lists for over $200.

The battery life has become pathetic.  The GPS has also begun to behave poorly. In my car, on streets where I didn\'t have a problem getting signal during the first 6 months I had the phone, I lose signal and google maps says ""searching for GPS"".  Read a book using the kindle app, and you will burn 30% of battery in 2 hours.<br><br>This phone is not going to get an official version of Android P. I like everything about this phone, except for the flaky battery and GPS.  My refurb Nexus 7 tablet does not have issues like this.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I ordered this phone after my Zenfone 2 started falling apart after 7 months. It took some time to decide but I finally went with the Graphite 128GB model. With Prime, shipping was a breeze and I received it quickly along with a case I ordered.<br><br>This phone comes pre loaded with Android Marshmallow, the newest stable Android version. After getting it set up and using it for a month or so, ove come to the conclusion that it is a great phone. The exterior design looks very clean and minimalistic. There is no cover for a battery and you have a small tool to open the Nano-Sim slot which I found kind of lame at first but after a second thought I realized it was pretty cool.<br>On the back there is a small circle for the fingerprint scanner. I've never had a phone with one so that was very cool. The volume rocker and lock button are both on the right hand side, the previous phone I was using had the lock button on top and volume buttons on the back similar to an LG phone. Moving from that to side buttons took some adjusting but now I'm used to it.<br><br>The downfall so far was a defective speaker. This phone has 2 forward facing speakers, a top and bottom. The top speaker has a strange tinny sound while playing sound. Almost as if it's slightly blown. I learned from my last phone purchase that if there is a defect, I should get it handled as soon as I can, otherwise I will try to live with it till it gets worse.<br><br>I contacted Amazon and started the replacement process. They only had a refund available so I sent an email and they are working with me to get a replacement phone so I can transfer my current data, then send my old phone in. My replacement phone is in the mail and I'm very happy so far with the phone and the service.<br><br>2/27/16 update: after using the phone for a little bit, it appears that there are no further issues.

The screen then began to deteriorate.  The mountains in my wallpaper turned bright green.  Other things turned yellow.  Most of the edges of things are pixelated.  I suspect that it is hardware now, not software because the screenshots of these issues look fine when I email them to myself.<br><br>Huawei and Google won't do anything because it is outside of warranty.  This is a crippling problem that has now made the phone unusable.  However it is absurd that I would only get one usable year out of a phone at this price point.

Upon release of the Blackberry Z10, I converted and really thought nothing would ever beat the BB10 devices.  Now that even Blackberry has gone Android, I've moved on to the 6P and have to say this is the most amazing smartphone I've ever had.  The phone just works, the Android system is stable, video/mp3 playback is terrific, the 64GB of space makes up for the missing extension slot, the build quality is magnificent, and the phone looks and feels like a work of art.  The only downside is the relative rarity of USB Type C cables, but the fast charging and file transfer rates more than make up for that.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The Nexus 6P is the perfect balance of speed, power, premium feel, clutter free phone I had been searching for. The screen is amazing. My only complaint is that it's very bright even at the lowest brightness setting. Not a big deal.<br><br>It feels great in the hand although the size is a little bigger than I prefer but I can live with it.<br><br>The camera is the best I have ever used in a phone. It takes great pictures. Color is great. Colorful but not over saturated and does an amazing job in low light.<br><br>I purchased it with $50 discount from Google and a $50 gift card from Best Buy so net price was $400. The fact I purchased the phone upfront means my monthly phone bill will go down dramatically.<br><br>I would highly recommend this phone. Have had Samsung, HTC and Motorola premium phones but I still prefer the Nexus 6P.<br><br>Pros:<br>*Quick updates from Google<br>*Price is low compared to other premium phones<br>*Amazing pictures especially in low light<br>*Super fast charging<br>*Beautiful high res amoled screen<br>*No bloatware<br>*Premium build and specs<br>*USB C port is convenient<br>*Android Pay<br>*Front speakers are loud. Good for navigation.<br><br>Cons: (Non are a big deal for me)<br>*Size is slightly bigger than I prefer. Personal preference.<br>*No external micro SD port<br>*Not water resistant (At least not certified to be)<br>*No optical image stabilization.<br>*No wireless charging.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  I bought this coming from the Oneplus one.... I thought I had a great phone before, but I was floored by this phone. The fingerprint scanner is so useful! Worth the change by itself. The screen is clear, and the volume is loud. Brightness could be better, but its alright.<br><br>The phone lacks OIS (optical image stabilization), but even then, my photos are nice!<br><br>Gps is quick!<br><br>Battery life lasts pretty much all day with medium use. The quick charge however is the beast that should be praised on this little maching... I can fully charge my phone in like 1-2 hours! A 15 min charge does wonders! I will never get a phone without quick charge.<br><br>If you dont mind the customer support from Oneplus, maybe look at the ONeplus 3. This phone has all the bands necessary for USA Tmobile.<br><br>It could use some more ram... but it never freezes and never restarts for me.<br><br>Gets a little hot sometimes, but never an issue. Stick to USB c-c chargers, and look for 5v wall chargers. Otherwise you wont get the quick charge!<br><br>I wish it was waterproof and had a removable battery... but alas it works as intended.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I've been really happy with the Nexus 6P, though, at about a year old, it's probably showing its age. Then again, I don't have a newer phone to compare it to, so I don't really mind.<br><br>The screen is nice and sharp, it's responsive, the finger print sensor is fantastic and, yes, it's huge. But I got used to the size shortly after buying it.<br><br>So, now, with the Pixel and other newer phones on the market, does it make sense to get a Nexus? If it were me, and I were in the market, I would go for the 6P again. The technology in phones is so similar from one year to the next, that it's best to save a few bucks and not get the newest device on the market. That was much less a number of years ago, but now the differences are negligible. The camera on the new phones will be a little sharper and a little quicker to load, the benchmarks will be better (though, really, who cares about that?) and you can brag that you have the newest device. It's not that these things don't matter, but, to me, they don't matter given the much higher cost of the phone.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  The battery stopped working a week after the 1 year warranty ran out. I called their customer service line and they offered to have me pay to replace the battery at my cost. It soon stopped booting completely without being able to get any of my child's baby pictures off of it. Do not buy unless you are okay with knowing it will go bad within a year. Their customer service doesn't care to help with any issues either.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Got this phone less than 2 years. After 12 months the battery had noticeably less ability to hold charge.<br><br>After 18 months it would last about 30 minutes of ""screen on"" before turning off. And it would show 50-60% battery life when it turns off.<br><br>I finally got frustrated with it and decided to try and save money not buying a new phone. So I replaced the battery. After replacing the battery I can no longer get cell service.<br><br>This phone is a piece of junk. almost $500 wasted. Less than 2 years of use.<br><br>I\'m not even going to discuss the intermittent bluetooth failure.<br><br>Trash.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Bottom line: excellent phone. Its display is bright, clear, and large. The front facing dual audio speakers are unbelievable. The WiFi connection is much improved over my last phone. And the best thing is you get Android updates. I got two when I first got the phone (which is normal to update the firmware initially) but I also just got another security update the other day. My other phones (and I\'m not going to mention brands) rarely updated (if they updated at all). This phone has no bloatware so it is very fast. I had no issues pairing this phone to my car. Took only a minute or two to accomplish.<br>I was deciding between several new phones including OnePlus 3, ZTE Axon 7, the new Zenfone and about a half a dozen more. They are all probably good phones but so is this one and I know I will get firmware updates and get them quickly. Also, there are a zillion accessories available for the 6P.<br>Now to the size. I was concerned about a 5.7"" display phone but it is no issue whatsoever for me. If you have very small hands, it might be but it is personal preference. The phone is tall and not that wide so it is easy to hold. The phone is not heavy at all. In fact, it was surprising light for me; not feather light but certainly not even a slight concern.<br>The Nexus 6P is a keeper!\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Bought this phone 16 months ago and all of a sudden it just started shutting off at 93%. Apparently this is a common issue and people have reported that changing the battery will do the trick. I trust that information and I'll be replacing mine. The phone itself is great, best android phone I've ever had but for an average consumer, needing to replace the battery is a major kill. I will not recommend any Huawei product in the near future.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Where do i even begin? I had the Google Nexus 4 and I loved it. So I got this phone and was excited to plug it in and get it up and going and to my surprise, there was the charger to the base that a USB input. The phone takes the type c charger  (just like the pixel) so the cors for the charger was type c on both ends.... how was i supposed to charge my phone? My friend has a Pixel so i just figured id use that charger and buy another charger because im not unreasonable and understand that sh** happens sometimes. So i get home and im charging the phone so i can use it. I tried to figureout where the sim card was supposed to go and i figured it out but i didn't know how i was supposed to get it open. I knew you needed to insert some sort of tool to stick in the tiny tray hole to make it come out. There was a manual for the phone that didnt help and in the middle of that tiny manual was what i hoped would be the tool but no. There was what appeared to be a replacement for the sim card tray door but upon further inspection, i discovered it wasn't even something for my phone. I googled other options to open the slot and was able to insert the sim card and everything was finally working.  Even after of this crap, i still wanted to keep the phone. I downloaded all my stuff and when the phone was done charging, i took it off of the charger and i began to use it. About 20 minutes later, the phone died even though it was at 95%. I attempted to power in the phone and seemed to get stuck in some sort of loop. I finally plugged the phone back into the charger and tried it and it worked. Then i took it off the charger and began to use Snapchat and it died again.  This phone would have been the best thing ever if the damn battery would work. I loved it so much i thought id just replace the battery. Last week i googled how to do that. You have to break ipen the casing of the phone and it looked too risky for me so i just returned it today. I was disappointed because i purposefully got this specific phone from this specific place because it said it was an Amazon warehouse and i thought it would be most trustworthy.  I should have just turned around and sent it back when i realized they didnt even send matching phone materials. Im an introvert so i had a panic attack about going into UPS store so this whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. Now im without a phone and have to wait 7 to 10 days until my account gets refunded. I was going to get it refunded to my Amazon credit thing or whatever but i dont think i want to buy a cell phone from Amazon because i want to make sure it works beforehand.  I am still disappointed.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  I bought my phone from Amazon on July 23, 2016. My previous Nexus 4, which I had had since early 2013, had a fried SIM card, which rendered it incapable of sending and receiving texts. Since I had a good experience with Google products (premium phones at a decent price), the Nexus 6P seemed the logical candidate for my next phone. I have T-Mobile, and once my Nexus 6P arrived, there was absolutely no problem in obtaining a new SIM card.<br><br>I was astounded by the battery life, the quality, and appeal of the Nexus 6P. I recall that after all the updates and app-downloading, after almost a full 30 minutes of work, the battery was still at 98% (it wasn't plugged in). This phone carried me through my final year of undergraduate studies.<br><br>Now, for roughly a month I have been having the same problem as everyone else in the comments. At 30%, my phone will turn off, and remain off, until it is plugged in. Today, after a workout, it turned off at 50% (I had a live update on the Switzerland-Costa Rica World Cup match).<br>This is a little ridiculous to be honest. I expect my phone to do four things: text, call, play music, and last for at least three years. This phone behaves like it will not make it to the second year of use.<br><br>It is a good phone, there is no denying that. But there is a serious flaw which compromises it after a certain amount of time. From what I can tell, Google and Huawei face several class-action lawsuits from people with similar complaints. Moreover, if you bought your phone from Amazon, as I did, you're SOL. Google only honors warranties from purchases on their website. If you bought it through Amazon, you have to claim a warranty via Huawei, and as far as I am aware, their customer service has been well versed in the art of telling poor, hapless 6P purchasers where they can go shove their warranty claims.<br><br>I don't know whether the proper thing would be to attempt a fix, or to give it up as a lost cause.\n</span>""]"

I think the signal when on battery is being misread by the android OS.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT THIS PHONE TO LAST LONGER THAN A YEAR. I\'M SERIOUS - SAVE YOUR $600 FOR ANOTHER DEVICE!<br><br>First off, I\'m a big Nexus family fan. Owned a Nexus 5 and 6 prior to this and I loved them. Sadly, I\'m clumsy, and smashed both their screens in roughly a year/year and a half of owning each. After smashing the 6, I decided, ""Why not upgrade since I\'m SOL?"" So, I bought the Nexus 6P, and I loved it for months and months. Stock Android with an unlockable bootloader plus great software support? Fantastic.<br><br>However, issues began less than a year later. This device suffers from a major hardware defect that, in roughly a years time, may likely render it completely unusable. It has happened to many an unhappy owner of this device, and it happened to me. The nexus 6P is truly a ticking time bomb. Now, if you bought it straight from Google, Google will replace it for you within a year. That\'s not perfect, but they\'ve been giving out upgrades to those unfortunate enough to have their 6P stop working for no reason due to bootlooping.<br><br>BUT, here\'s the catch. The seller on Amazon here is the other manufacturer of the device: Huawei. Huawei will not only make it as difficult as possible to help you, they will LIE if it means they don\'t have to help you.<br><br>When I tried to contact them for a replacement or some kind of help (read: ANY kind of help at all, because my phone doesn\'t work), Huawei gave me a FALSE date of purchase somewhere in July of 2016 to attempt to tell me my warranty expired and that ""there\'s nothing they can do.""<br><br>I called Huawei out on their bullshit and gave them my actual date of purchase through Amazon. Afterwards, Huawei (I kid you not) wanted me to send a picture of ALL SIX sides of my device PLUS a screenshot of my amazon online receipt (Becuase screenshots can\'t be doctored, right?) to their EMAIL.<br><br>After jumping through their ridiculous hoops that were completely unneccesary, I EVENTUALLY got an email that told me to ""call them"" to talk about it. Because, after talking to a representative in the online chat, going through a lengthy email chain, sending them 7 picture of the device to their address, they now wanted me to CALL them to fix my problem if NOT having a phone to make calls from. While I might have been able to borrow a colleague\'s phone to make this call, I decided it wasn\'t worth my time. Huawei was very fine with taking my $600 and leaving me with a defective device.<br><br>Save yourself some trouble and don\'t purchase the 6P. It\'s a sad note to end the Nexus lineage, but honestly, the Pixel is probably worth the extra $200ish. Purchasing the 6P is essentially purchasing a ticking time bomb that may or may not go off roughly when your warranty expires.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  Horrible phone. I loved it at first, but now I am having serious battery issues. The other morning I was filming video at 85% battery when all of a sudden the screen flickered and the battery went to 0% in a millisecond and shut off. After trying to turn the phone back on, the battery signal went on and showed me that my phone was dead. (What the heck?) So then I was stranded without a phone for the rest of the day because I didn't have my charger with me. Now I have to keep my charger with me 24/7. So disappointed in both of you, Huawei + Google!\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Warranty support on this product was absolutely terrible.  I initially checked warranty eligibility on the Huawei web site and learned my warranty expired on May 18, 2017, just 2 days after the phone began an unrecoverable boot loop problem.  It was difficult to contact them, difficult to communicate with them, and they finally explained to me that even though their company web site said the warranty expired on May 18, they consider the warranty to have already expired on May 8th, on year after the product shipped, even though I did not receive it until a day later.  In other words, Huawei would not even honor the warranty date that was on their own company web site.  After speaking with a customer service supervisor and getting the same response I was told that I should take my phone to Best Buy/Geeks Squad to get it repaired.  After driving to Best Buy and standing in line for 30 minutes the representative their told me that they could not work on the phone and could not imagine why the customer service supervisor at Huawei would have told me to go there.  Awful experience.  I would not buy another Huawei product.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  By far the worst device that I've ever come across. The infamous bootloop issue that renders it a useless paperweight, to its false claims of battery life make his a lemon of epic proportions. Huawei is a joke, and should be avoided like the plague.\n</span>"", '<span>\n  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM ANYONE EXCEPT GOOGLE. All you have to do is ""Google Huawei Nexus 6P Warranty"" and you will find and endless number of horror stories. I will make an extremely long and complicated story short and say that my phone stopped working within the 1-year manufacturers warranty time period, and the manufacturer has done nothing but lie and evade for the past month. At this point, I don\'t expect them to ever honor the warranty, especially since discovering that they are treating thousands of other customers exactly the same way. Amazon has thus far told me they cannot help me at all. I will never buy another phone off of Amazon again.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I wrote this review when I first got the phone and it is still performing very well, but I can say that the wifi capability may not be as good as I hoped, not sure if this is normal on phones because I don't remember (I used to use the computer instead of a phone) but I definitely feel that over time the wifi capability has decreased (it lags sometimes and it is not the internet service as I have other devices that work without any problems). It is good to reboot the phone from time to time because it also tends to get a bit slow, I do it maybe once every 2 weeks.<br>Also the battery does last a day but now I have to charge it the following morning or at night, it is draining a bit faster than before. It still takes great pics but sometimes I have to wait a few seconds before I can take the next shot and it wasn't like that at the beginning, and also tends to lose focus when taking a video (not all the time, but it didn't happen before)<br><br>I won't take stars away because it is a great phone and I still recommend it but I may change it once the new nokia with android comes out.<br><br>*********<br><br>The phone is amazing, takes great pictures, resolution is great, the audio and speakers are amazing as well, it's really fast and the battery lasts over a day! unless I use it a lot for gaming or YouTube it lasts a day but if I don't, I can wait until mid day the following day and then I charge it, it has a do not disturb feature so I don't have to leave it without audio for the night, I just turn on the feature and choose which time I want it to turn off so I can get my notifications again...<br>I just love it!

Unfortunately my  phone developed this problem just a few months out of the 1 year warranty and now I'm basically stuck carrying an external battery around because who knows when my phone will die. Tried calling Google and they were very friendly but said they couldn't help (since I didn't purchase from the Google store) so they transferred me to Huawei.

I am an electrician/millwright/mechanic, so I use phones pretty harshly.  My first smart phone was a GSM Samsung Focus I917.  I liked the phone, especially the size, and it held up well with it's gel case.  It even survived being slammed between the body of my car and the trunk without cracking the screen.  It just fell behind technologically.  Many of the windows phone apps, and the web browsing became unsupported.<br><br>My next phone was a new old stock GSM AT&amp;T Samsung S5 Mini.  It met most of my requirements.  I loved the still small size and rugged design that I used with a plastic screen protector and a gel case.  I was happy with it for a couple years, except I was unable to upgrade android above 5.1, and technologically, again, it was starting to fall behind.  Things weren't being supported for that android version.  Also, around that time, the USB mini charging port started to fail, and I started to have to swap batteries with an external charger to be able to use it.  It was clear it was time for something else.<br><br>My next purchase was a GSM Cubot King-Kong Mini.  It lasted all of a month as a phone.  I really liked the size of it, I liked the USB C charging port, Android 9, and some other features, but with no 4G for the US, a weaker camera than my S5 mini, and having it suddenly lose all cell phone signal altogether, I was on the lookout for another inexpensive compact rugged phone.  I guess I'll use it as a smart MP3 player from now on.<br><br>While the Ulefone Armor X7 Pro (2020) is quite a bit larger (almost an inch both ways), and knowing I would really miss the smaller size of the King-Kong Mini,  I decided to give it a try.  So far, it has met my expectations.  It is quite large to me, but probably around the size of a full size Samsung S5 with a heavy duty case on it.  To me, it is difficult to hold on to due to it's larger size, and it is difficult to put in your pocket, but so far as many times as I have dropped it, it has performed well and not shown any signs of damage.  The speed of the processor seems good, the upgrade-able storage is nice (I added a 128GB SD card), and the phone works like it should.  The battery life is excellent.  I can go about 2 days without charging it.  I like the larger screen size for web browsing, and texting, and the larger screen size makes it easier to do those things, but overall, I would prefer a more compact phone.  The camera seems as good or better than that on my S5 mini.  One thing I was disappointed I had to go back to with the Ulefone, though, was the mini USB charging port.  The USB-C on the Cubot just seemed nicer, especially plugging it in before bed in the dark.  So far, though, I'd say it's a keeper, at least as long as I can keep it in one piece.  My life, and the type of work I do, is very tough on phones.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Overall I like this phone. It does what it's supposed to do, and only $130 bucks on sale. I've used it in the ocean with no problems, video And pics. Having to press ok on the underwater camera is annoying and didn't work underwater. It DID work on Verizon, but could not receive texts. Sending, calling, and data we're fine, but it did disconnect. I switched to TRACFONE on at&amp;t and it's been good so far, but deprioritization is bad. Battery last for about 4 days with normal use. Sound is a little low in noisy areas on speaker phone.<br><br>I installed no root firewall and it looks like it only tried to check in with the Chinese manufacturer on boot up and for updates, so I don't *think* it's sending data other than that.<br><br>I prefer matte screen protectors, but the way this screen is designed they actually make it hard to read and blurry. The stock clear one that comes with it is the best so far.<br><br>I bought an iPhone 11 aduro holster, put the phone in it, and used a heat gun to soften the sides so it would fit, since I couldn't find one for it. Didn't put the phone in the holder for it, just slides straight in the holster.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Bought this for my hubby who has broken every phone he's ever owned. Thus far he's impressed with it! It is heavy, but that's a small price to pay for one that lasts longer than a day! I'm considering getting one for myself also\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Overall, I am highly pleased with the Armor x7 and have already recommended it to few people.<br><br>The positives include price, storage, appearence, and the underwater camera is cool. I tested it hoping it work in our pool. It does and the picture were perfect.<br><br>Theres not many negatives. Its a little thick. I think the resolution could be slightly sharper but is still solid.<br><br>I think this phone is amazing and i paid 140. Ive seen it for 99 now and im not even mad . So its a buy.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Bought after cracking the screen on iPhone. I did not log into anything google, so no google account tracking. Was able to load several important apps using apk instead of google play. Signal is significantly stronger than old iphone in the same location, and sound quality is perfect. Camera seems to work well, and battery was still at 80% after using it all day. Seems to be a very good phone and am quite pleased... time will tell, but it seems very tough, is pretty heavy, and screen is gorgeous. Wish it was made in USA.\n</span>', '<span>\n  I do not know if I got a bad phone or not. But I am not to happy. One spot on the screen never picks up (where the number 6 is) without several taps. Half the time when you take a pic, it simply vanishes. It randomly shuts apps down (like my weather app, camera app, any app you try to leave run, it eventually Kills it).<br>You can not scroll down a page without it opening some hyper link on it. Just a horrible experience and a horrible phone.\n</span>', '<span>\n  So far I am liking this phone a lot.  Just have to get use to it.  I am use to motorola phones so some things are different.  Made a few adjustments to get it to work on Verizon network and seems to be working.  I can give a better overall in the next few months.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  The over all performance of the phone is great.. The pre-installed apps were awesome example thete is app to help you center a pic you hang on wall and a few mtore that was very useful... the underwater video camara and pics were great i really enjoyed that. It was easy top use comfortable to hold and great memory.. Now the party I don't like it says it is pretty much noon breakable dueto being army grade well I say that might be noy l so true.. I was opening the front door it slipped out of my hands and screen shattered. I mean still turns on just cannot get it to work glass is to broken..\n</span>"", '<span>\n  It has a mind of its own. Can’t get my friends or family. My address book is jumbled as a senior it is too confusing.\n</span>', '<span>\n  Haven’t really had the chance to test everything yet but so far so good, I have dropped it on the road and it’s fine, haven’t tried in water yet so we will see!\n</span>']"

The screen is beautiful, finger print sensor is very, VERY fast and precise, camera is much better than the one in the LG G4, having nicier colors, much better IQ (pictures attached are straight from the phone).

I still miss some of the features that I found in the LGs flagship that I owned in the past, but nothing relevant anyway. The battery is an issue. It suddenly die sometimes when I am doing something intensive (taking pictures, watching videos, etc) even when the battery indicator says it is 60% or so.  I did some researches and I found that this machine have problems with the Huawei batteries and it requires that you replace them. I guess many people sold early this phone because of the battery issue. I replaced mine for $60, so at the end, you have to add this value to the value of the phone. This is something to consider because, when I did my research I only considered the price of a used phone to compare with other alternatives, but at the end it cost me $60 more. It is a good phone anyway, and to me it would worth $60 more.<br>Note: I had to ask for a new SIM card to Verizon (Vz) because it needed the micro card,  and then I call to Vz to activate the new card, but they said they cannot activate it because it is not in the list of the phones used by them.

I've looked up battery change methods, and it's not really a simple end-user task at all.  The 6P has quite a bit of notoriety for this problem.  Perhaps it's tolerated because consumers have a habit of changing phones like pants, but if you don't have that kind of money, don't bother with this thing.<br>I give it two stars though, because for the year and 3/4th it worked for me, it was a champ.

The V10 was only able to go to AT&amp;T and was only able to do LTE partially and after much finagling.<br>* Updates: The Nexus gets the latest updates fast, and if you want to sign up for the developer program (which I have) you can run newer releases of Android. I am running Android N (Nougat) which has some subtle but nice improvements. Very stable at this point.<br>* Crapware: No Crapware! No LG apps or UI. No T-Mobile apps that you can't uninstall. Awesome! The great V10 phone was unfortunately bogged down with tons of useless software and bad user interface.<br>* Battery: The 6P has a much longer lasting battery. I have been getting a full day out of it where the V10 would need a charge at some point in the day more often than not.<br>* Screen: The AMOLED screen on the 6P is subtly better but very welcome. Nothing wrong with the V10, but the 6P is just better.<br>* Weight: The 6P is a bit lighter.<br>* Build Quality: The 6P has great build quality. I haven't dropped it yet so we shall see how it holds up. The V10 is a great phone in this regard, even better build quality, but both phones are excellent.<br>* Fingerprint reader: The 6P wins hands down and reads your fingerprint nearly every time and you are in fast. V10 required retries probably 20% of the time.<br><br>The Bad:<br>* Expandable Memory: The 6P does not have an expansion slot whereas the V10 does. It can't cost that much to add the slot, in fact the SIM tray looks like it is sized for having one. Allow us to put in a micro SD!<br>* Button Placement: The V10 wins hands down with the elegant placement of the power and volume buttons on the back. The power button and fingerprint reader are the same button, very elegant. I am constantly hitting the volume button when picking up the 6P on the side of the phone. V10 sides are clean, no accidental volume adjustment.<br><br>The Ugly:<br>Nothing to report here on the 6P. Maybe the grip factor as the aluminum of the 6P is more slippery than the V10 with its stainless steel sides and rubber back. The V10 with its crapware, slower updates, and missing features on other carriers was the main reasons I switched. If the V10 where released as an unlocked phone on all carriers I would still be using that. But to my knowledge there isn't a variant of the V10 that does that.<br><br>Overall:<br>The 6P wins hands down. Great phone.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Bought mine in June 2016 and am currently having the same issues that everyone else is reporting - battery life is godawful, OS is buggy and slow, and have gotten zero help and support from Google and Huawei despite the issues with the phone being well known among users.  Definitely regret buying this and am hesitant to buy another Android device again, let alone a Google one after the total lack of customer service from their side.  I'm someone who thinks that if you drop several hundred on a phone it should last for a few years, and this phone has had by far the most problems out of any smartphone I've owned (iOS and Android).  If you're like me and buy phones to use for a few years, I'd think twice before picking up this one or any of Google's phones until they've demonstrated that their devices are built to last.\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Fantastic phone in nearly every way. Beautifully designed, with a spectacularly good fingerprint sensor (puts my old iPhone 6Plus to shame), good buttons, sharp screen, and nice camera (not quite as crisp/color-accurate as the iPhone 6, I'd say, but it does have excellent low-light functionality.) The camera is really the only thing I'd want improved, other than perhaps a little more screen brightness in direct sunlight.<br><br>Camera is a little warm in its tone/shoots a little darker than I'd like it to, is a touch slow to respond, and also can't take macro shots worth a damn; it requires you to be several inches away from your subject to focus, which is a bummer when I find a cool flower or insect or funky little micro-scene or microclimate to photograph. This means I still need to carry a separate camera to do anything macro-related. For bigger stuff though, and for people, it does a great job.<br><br>The only other real downside of this phone is that, because it isn't produced at a scale rivaling the iPhone or Samsung S-series, accessories are a little tough to find. But the Intelliglass screen cover and SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle case are excellent accompaniments, and work as well as anything the iPhone's got, with the exception of any sort of waterproofing (which would be nice.)\n</span>"", '<span>\n  Do not buy this phone!!! I am so disappointed. I bought this phone in February as a refurbished phone in *very good condition. Yesterday it turned off while I was taking a picture. Since then it has refused to turn all the way on being stuck in a boot loop mode. It turns to the google screen then turns off again. Apparently this is a common problem with the phone. I called the manufacturer and they could not help me as apparently my warrenty ended in July and it is now August. So essentially I paid 400 $ for a phone that has lasted me 6 months. Both google and Huawei- how are you making a product with such an issue? And how are you refusing to help a customer fix it?<br>So disappointed and frustrated!!!\n</span>', '<span>\n  I just got it on 8/26/16 so its a bit to early to tell how the product is so we\'ll just have to wait sorry.<br><br>If your not use to The Huawei Nexus 6P then your in for a shock along with all the great features comes the side of this phone and my hands are big.<br><br>Inside the box is the phone, one USB-C to USB-C cable and Charger and one very short USB to USB-C cable, also one cardboard instructions sheet, booklet in 3 languages and a key, now if you\'re like me and never used that tech before then its time for some homework.<br><br>This phone uses USB-C. USB-C is a faster data and power rate cable the end is much smaller that your regular USB connector, It won\'t work with your Standard USB 2.0 or 3.0 slots, it does come with one ""Short"" USB 3.0 to USB-C cable which is backwards compatible with a USB 2.0 slot but charging time is waaaaaay slow. so If you can use a 3.0 slot with the USB-C cable then use that. In the mean time use the wall charger as often as possible.  Battery time is amazing one charge lasted me about 11 hours and i still had half he battery left.<br><br>On to the nano sim. What\'s that you say? Nano? yes, its much smaller than your regular micro sim card, in the box came a circle with a pin on the end to open the card slot on the side, mine was so easy to install. T-moble wanted to charge me 20.00 for a nano sim, but you can buy one on here for 5 bucks so save your money.<br><br>Updating was so fast compared to my other phones, this phone is a true google phone so updates were done though a WiFi connection with a full battery and it took a few minutes to update. Once that was done, it was time to download my previous apps, because of the large amounts of space, mine is the 64 gig version, but in retrospect, it might have been better to spend the extra money for 128 gigs, my previous phone only had 8 gig and with the update to lollipop filled my phones memory by half.<br><br>This phone was so easy to work with, and because everything went though ""Big Brother"" Google all of my ""everything\'s"" was there so it was like moving into a bigger house with all my furniture inside. Amazing. So with the update on marshmallow and app download it took up about 3.5 gigs. so bye bye memory hello big phone and better performance.<br><br>So far, so good. Stay tuned folks. Lets see if all this hype is bulls***.<br><br>UPDATE: 5/9/2018 Its been almost two years since i got this phone, for a Google flagship phone it\'s had its ups and down, Google has introduced two phones since then the Pixel and the Pixel XL and the Pixel 2 and you guessed it the Pixel 2 XL and are about to give those phones a run for its money. Personally those are the same phone with differnt processors and memory. That\'s just my educated Opinon like faux news. I\'ve keep in touch with other Nexus 6P owners on Reddit r/nexus6p, i\'ve had no major issues, nothing fell off i\'ve changed cases and the shielding on the face of this phone and WOW nothing has happen so far.<br>I use this phone for everything from news and info, To games and VR, to shopping and porn, Everything. I get about 6 hours of good battery life, with light use. I\'ve had 3 major updates from Kit Kat to Marshmellow and now Orieo, no bootloops so far. There was this time when the FBI put out a warning about Chinese spy\'s, once again hype, the mounting bullshit is amazing.<br><br>Its still fast and appart from some minor hickups that was corrected by battery discharged and a full restart didn\'t correct this phone is a monster. Don\'t let anyone fool you this is the go to phone when you want solid hardward and great software. My last phone came from Blu it lasted less than a year. If you do buy this phone keep your updates going don\'t mess with the OS and keep this phone away from moisture.<br><br>I\'m keeping the phone till it dies, More update to follow.\n</span>', ""<span>\n  I love this phone! Had Galaxy S7 Edge, replaced it with this one. I will be saving a lot of money by getting off my carrier's every phone new every year plan. Thus phone is new, but has been on the market for almost one year now, still like it better than my S7 Edge. I will have a newer operating system than the S7 in another month, Android 7!<br>Reasons why:<br>Edge screen was a gimmick to me, and a inconvenience. I would always accidentally hit the edge screen opening something or the keyboard would open and have a letter right on the edge to try and type on causing errors.<br>  Speakers you can hear! Samsung dropped the ball here. Water proofing is nice, but if it quiets the speakers so much that it's hard to hear- no thanks<br>Has dual front facing speakers!<br>  Had 8 cores for processor vs 4 cores in USA model S7 Edge<br>  I get Android updates right away. Android 7.0 is out for me soon, S7 won't get it for probably 6 to 12 more months<br>  USB type C is nice, (both sides of plugin are the same, can plug in in the dark)<br>  Big nice ratio sized screen. S7 has same length, but is very narrow, don't like it.<br>  Security updates are more frequent with 6P than with a S7<br>  I love the unlock screen on the back of phone. It never fails, unlike my S7. 6p is very fast unlocking too.<br>  No lag, like S7 has, pure Android\n</span>"", ""<span>\n  Amazing phone with a large crisp screen and front facing speakers. Easily the best phone I have ever owned coming from owning both Apple and samsung phones. The problem however comes from the issues that started coming up about a year into owning this phone. There is a common problem with the noise cancelling mic also cancelling your voice. This leads to no one understanding what you're saying unless you use speaker phone. Thus unfortunately persisted even after I sent it back to HUAWEI for repairs. Another even more concerning issue is the battery. After a year of use the battery has become extremely unreliable. It will randomly shut off whenever it wants. I have seen it shut off at percentages as high as 70. Beware of the issues that come with this phone. I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 if these issues weren't there but apparently they are common issues with this phone. I have 2 friends with similar issues.\n</span>""]"
